1</span>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; IPSWICH</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;The Great White Horse</h3>
<p>This ancient Inn is associated with some pleasant and
diverting Pickwickian memories.&nbsp; We think of the adventure
with &ldquo;the lady in the yellow curl papers&rdquo; and the
double-bedded room, just as we would recall some &ldquo;side
splitting&rdquo; farce in which Buckstone or Toole once made our
jaws ache.&nbsp; As all the world knows, the &ldquo;Great White
Horse&rdquo; is found in the good old town of Ipswich, still
flourishes, and is scarcely altered from the days when Mr.
Pickwick put up there.&nbsp; Had it not been thus associated,
Ipswich would have remained a place obscure and scarcely known,
for it has little to attract save one curious old house and some
old churches; and for the theatrical antiquary, the remnant of
the old theatre in Tacket Street, where Garrick first appeared as
an amateur under the name of Lyddal, about a hundred and sixty
years ago, and where now the Salvation Army
&ldquo;performs&rdquo; in his stead. <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a>&nbsp; The touch of
&ldquo;Boz&rdquo; kindled the old bones into life, it peopled the
narrow, winding streets with the Grummers, Nupkins, Jingles,
Pickwick and his followers; with the immortal lady aforesaid in
her yellow curl papers, to say nothing of Mr. Peter Magnus.&nbsp;
From afar off even, we look at Ipswich with a singular interest;
some of us go down there to enjoy the peculiar feeling&mdash;and
it <i>is</i> a peculiar <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>and piquant one&mdash;of staying at
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s Inn&mdash;of sleeping even in his
room.&nbsp; This relish, however, is only given to your true
&ldquo;follower,&rdquo; not to his German-metal
counterfeit&mdash;though, strange to say, at this moment,
Pickwick is chiefly &ldquo;made in Germany,&rdquo; and comes to
us from that country in highly-coloured almanacks&mdash;and
pictures of all kinds.&nbsp; About Ipswich there is a very
appropriate old-fashioned tone, and much of the proper country
town air.&nbsp; The streets seem dingy enough&mdash;the hay
waggon is encountered often.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Great White
Horse,&rdquo; which is at the corner of several streets, is a
low, longish building&mdash;with a rather seedy air.&nbsp; But to
read &ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s&rdquo; description of it, we see at once
that he was somewhat overpowered by its grandeur and immense
size&mdash;which, to us in these days of huge hotels, seems
odd.&nbsp; It was no doubt a large posting house of many small
chambers&mdash;and when crowded, as &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; saw it at
Election time in 1835, swarming with committeemen, agents, and
voters, must have impressed more than it would now.&nbsp; The
Ball-room at &ldquo;The Bull,&rdquo; in Rochester, affected him
in much the same way; and there is a curious sensation in looking
round us there, on its modest proportions&mdash;its little hutch
of a gallery which would hold about half-a-dozen musicans, and
the small contracted space at the top where the
&ldquo;swells&rdquo; of the dockyard stood together.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Boz,&rdquo; as he himself once told me, took away from
Rochester the idea that its old, red brick Guildhall was one of
the most imposing edifices in Europe, and described his
astonishment on his return at seeing how small it was.</p>
<p>Apropos of Rochester and the Pickwick feeling, it may be said
that to pass that place by on the London, Chatham, and Dover line
rouses the most curious sensation.&nbsp; Above is the Castle,
seen a long time before, with the glistening river at its feet;
then one skirts the town passing by the backs of the very
old-fashioned houses, and you can recognise those of the
Guildhall and of the Watts&rsquo; Charity, and the gilt vanes of
other quaint, old buildings; you see a glimpse of the road rising
and falling, with its pathways raised on each side, with all
sorts of faded tints&mdash;mellow, subdued reds, sombre greys, a
patch of green here and there, and all more or less dingy, and
&ldquo;quite out of fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a rather
forlorn tone over it all, especially when <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>we have a
glimpse of Ordnance Terrace, at Chatham, that abandoned,
dilapidated row where the boy Dickens was brought up dismally
enough.&nbsp; At that moment the images of the Pickwickians recur
as of persons who had lived and had come down there on this
pleasant adventure.&nbsp; And how well we know every stone and
corner of the place, and the tone of the place!&nbsp; We might
have lived there ourselves.&nbsp; Positively, as we walk through
it, we seem to recognise localities like old friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boz,&rdquo; when he came to Ipswich, was no more than a
humble reporter, on special duty, living in a homely way
enough.&nbsp; The &ldquo;White Horse&rdquo; was not likely to put
itself out for him, and he criticises it in his story, after a
fashion that seems rather bold.&nbsp; His description is
certainly unflattering:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the main street, on the left-hand side
of the way&rdquo;&mdash;observe how minute Boz is in his
topography&mdash;&ldquo;a short distance after you have passed
through the open space fronting the Town Hall, stands an Inn
known far and wide by the appellation of &lsquo;The Great White
Horse,&rsquo; rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of
some rampacious animal, with flowing mane and tail, distantly
resembling an insane cart horse, which is elevated above the
principal door.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Great White Horse&rsquo; is
famous in the neighbourhood in the same degree as a prize ox or
county paper-chronicled turnip, or unwieldy pig&mdash;for its
<i>enormous size</i>.&nbsp; Never were there such labyrinths of
<i>uncarpeted passages</i>, such clusters of <i>mouldy</i>,
<i>badly-lighted rooms</i>, such huge numbers of small dens for
eating or sleeping in, beneath any other roof, as are collected
between the four walls of this overgrown Tavern.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boz cannot give the accommodation a good word, for he calls
the Pickwickian room &ldquo;a large, badly furnished apartment,
with <i>a dirty grate</i> in which a small fire was making a
wretched attempt to be cheerful, but was fast sinking beneath the
dispiriting influence of the place.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dinner, too,
seems to have been as bad, for a <i>bit of fish</i> and a steak
took one hour to get ready, with &ldquo;<i>a bottle of the worst
possible port</i>, <i>at the highest possible
price</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Depreciation of a hostelry could not be
more damaging.&nbsp; Again, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s bedroom is
described as a sort of surprise, being &ldquo;a more
comfortable-looking apartment that his short experience of the
accommodation of the Great White House had led him to
expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Now this was bad enough, but his sketch of the waiter who
received the arriving party is worse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A corpulent man, with a fortnight&rsquo;s
napkin under his arm and coeval stockings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is something so hostile in all this that it certainly
must have come from a sense of bad reception.&nbsp; As we said,
the young reporter was likely enough to have been treated with
haughty contempt by the corpulent waiter so admirably described,
with his &ldquo;coeval stockings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the poor horse is not spared, &ldquo;Rampacious&rdquo; he
is styled; the stone animal that still stands over the
porch.&nbsp; It must be said that the steed in question is a very
mild animal indeed, and far from ramping, is trotting placidly
along.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rampacious,&rdquo; however, scarcely seems
correct&mdash;&ldquo;Rampagious&rdquo; is the proper
form&mdash;particularly as &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; uses the words
&ldquo;On the rampage.&rdquo;&nbsp; We find ourselves ever
looking at the animal with interest&mdash;as he effects his trot,
one leg bent.&nbsp; The porch, and horse above it, have a sort of
sacred character.&nbsp; I confess when I saw it for the first
time I looked at it with an almost absurd reverence and
curiosity.&nbsp; The thing is so much in keeping, one would
expect to see the coach laden with Pickwickians drive up.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s adventure, his losing his way in the
passages, &amp;c., might occur to anyone.&nbsp; It is an odd
feeling, the staying at this old hostelry, and, as it draws on
towards midnight, seeking your room, through endless windings,
turns, and short flights.&nbsp; There is even now to be seen the
niche where Mr. Pickwick sat down for the night; so minute are
the directions we can trace the various rooms.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick
asked for a private room and was taken down a &ldquo;long dark
passage.&rdquo;&nbsp; It turned out later that Miss
Witherfield&rsquo;s sitting-room was actually next door, so Mr.
Magnus had not far to go.&nbsp; These rooms were on the ground
floor, so Mr. Pickwick had to &ldquo;descend&rdquo; from his
bedroom.</p>
<p>There is a tradition indeed that Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
adventure with a lady really occurred to &ldquo;Boz&rdquo;
himself, who had lost his way in the mazes of the passages.&nbsp;
I have a theory that his uncomfortable night in the passages, and
the possible displeasure of the authorities, may have jaundiced
his views.</p>
<h3><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>II.&mdash;Eatanswill and Ipswich</h3>
<p>It is not &ldquo;generally known&rdquo; that Ipswich is
introduced twice in the book: as Eatanswill, as well asunder its
own proper name.&nbsp; As &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; was dealing with the
corrupt practices at Elections, and severely ridiculing them, he
was naturally afraid of being made responsible.&nbsp; Further, he
had been despatched by the proprietors of the <i>Chronicle</i> to
report the speeches at the election, and he did not care to take
advantage of his mission for literary purposes.&nbsp; The father
of the late Mr. Alfred Morrison, the well-known, amiable
virtuoso, was one of the candidates for Ipswich at the election
in 1835, and he used to tell how young &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; was
introduced into one of the rooms at the &ldquo;Great White
Horse,&rdquo; where the head-quarters of the candidate was.&nbsp;
Sir Fitzroy Kelly was the other candidate, a name that seems
pointed at in Fizkin.</p>
<p>This high and mighty point of the locality of Eatanswill has
given rise to much discussion, and there are those who urge the
claims of other towns, such as Yarmouth and Norwich.&nbsp; It has
been ingeniously urged that, in his examination before Nupkins,
Mr. Pickwick stated that he was a perfect stranger in the town,
and had no knowledge of any householders there who could be bail
for him.&nbsp; Now if Eatanswill were Ipswich, he must have known
many&mdash;the Pott family for instance&mdash;and he had resided
there for some time.&nbsp; But the author did not intend that the
reader should believe that the two places were the same, and
wished them to be considered different towns, though <i>he</i>
considered them as one.&nbsp; It has been urged, too, that
Ipswich is not on the direct road to Norwich as stated by the
author; but on consulting an old road book (Mogg&rsquo;s) I find
that it is one of the important stages on the coach line.</p>
<p>But what is conclusive is the question of distance.&nbsp; On
hurrying away so abruptly from Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s, Mr.
Pickwick was told by that lady that the adventurer was at Bury
St. Edmunds, &ldquo;<i>not many miles from here</i>,&rdquo; that
is a short way off.&nbsp; Now Bury is no more than about
four-and-twenty miles from Ipswich, a matter of about four
hours&rsquo; coach travelling.&nbsp; Great Yarmouth is fully
seventy by roundabout roads, which could not be described as
being &ldquo;a <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>short way from here.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
would have taken eight or nine hours&mdash;a day&rsquo;s
journey.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick left Eatanswill about one or two, for
the lunch was going on, and got to Bury in time for dinner,
which, had he left Yarmouth, would have taken him to the small
hours of the morning.</p>
<p>No one was such a thorough &ldquo;Pressman&rdquo; as was
&ldquo;Boz,&rdquo; or threw himself with such ardour into his
profession.&nbsp; To his zeal and knowledge in this respect we
have the warmest testimonies.&nbsp; When he was at Ipswich for
the election, he, beyond doubt, entered with zest and enjoyment
into all the humours.&nbsp; No one could have written so minute
and hearty an account without having been &ldquo;behind the
scenes&rdquo; and in the confidence of one or other of the
parties.&nbsp; And no wonder, for he represented one of the most
important of the London &ldquo;dailies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact is, Ipswich was a sort of a tempestuous borough, the
scene of many a desperate conflict in which one individual, Mr.
Fitzroy Kelly&mdash;later Chief Baron&mdash;made the most
persevering efforts, again and again renewed, to secure his
footing.&nbsp; Thus, in December, 1832, there was a fierce
struggle with other candidates, Messrs. Morrison, Dundas, and
Rigby Wason, in which he was worsted&mdash;for the moment.&nbsp;
But, in January, 1835, when he stood again, he was
successful.&nbsp; This must have been the one in Pickwick, when
the excesses there described may have taken place.&nbsp; There
were four candidates: one of whom, Mr. Dundas&mdash;no doubt
depicted as the Honourable Mr. Slumkey&mdash;being of the noble
family of Zetland.&nbsp; We find that the successful candidate
was unseated on petition, and his place taken by another
candidate.&nbsp; In 1837, he stood once more, and was defeated by
a very narrow majority.&nbsp; On a scrutiny, he was restored to
Parliament.&nbsp; Finally, in 1847, he lost the seat and gave up
this very uncertain borough.&nbsp; Now all this shows what forces
were at work, and that, with such determined candidates,
electoral purity was not likely to stand in the way.&nbsp; All
which makes for Ipswich.</p>
<p>It must be said, however, that a fair case can be made for
Norwich.&nbsp; In introducing Eatanswill, Boz says that &ldquo;an
anxious desire to abstain from giving offence&rdquo; prompted Mr.
Pickwick, <i>i.e.</i>, Boz, to conceal the real name of the
place.&nbsp; He adds that he travelled by the Norwich coach,
&ldquo;but this entry (in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>notes) was
afterwards lined through as if for the purpose of concealing even
the direction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some might think that this was a
veiled indication, but it seems too broad and obvious a method,
that is, by crossing out a name to reveal the name.&nbsp; It is
much more likely he meant that the town was somewhere between
Norwich and London, and on that line.&nbsp; There are arguments,
too, from the distances.&nbsp; There are two journeys in the book
from Eatanswill to Bury, which seem to furnish data for both
theories&mdash;the Ipswich and the Norwich ones.&nbsp; But if we
have to take the <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> in its literal
sense, and put it early in the day, say, at eleven, and Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s arrival at Bury, &ldquo;wery late,&rdquo; as Sam
had it, we have some six hours, or, say, forty miles, covered by
the journey.&nbsp; But the events at Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s were
certainly at mid-day&mdash;between one and three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It was, in fact, a grand lunch.&nbsp; So
with Winkle&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; He left Eatanswill
half-an-hour after breakfast, and must have travelled by the same
coach as Mr. Pickwick had done, and reached Bury just in time for
dinner, or in six or seven hours.&nbsp; Now it will not be said
that he would not be a whole day going four-and-twenty miles.</p>
<p>A fair answer to these pleas might be that Boz was not too
scrupulous as to times or distances when he was contriving
incidents or events; and numberless specimens could be given of
his inaccuracies.&nbsp; Here, &ldquo;panting time toiled after
him in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was enough to talk of breakfast and
dinner without accurately computing the space between.&nbsp; But
a close admeasurement of the distance will disprove the Norwich
theory.&nbsp; Bury was twenty-four miles from Ipswich, and
Ipswich forty miles from Norwich&mdash;a total of seventy-four
miles, to accomplish which would have taken ten, eleven or twelve
hours, to say nothing of the chance of missing the
&ldquo;correspondance&rdquo; with the Northern Norwich
coach.&nbsp; Then again, Boz is careful to state that Eatanswill
was &ldquo;one of the smaller towns.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this class
we would not place Norwich, a large Cathedral City, with its
innumerable churches, and population, even then, of over 60,000,
whereas Ipswich was certainly one of these &ldquo;smaller
towns,&rdquo; having only 20,000.&nbsp; It must be also
considered, too, that this was a cross road, when the pace would
be slower than on the great main lines, say, at five miles an
hour, which, with stoppages, <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>&amp;c., would
occupy a period for the twenty-four miles of some four hours,
that is, say, from two to six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Boz, by his
arrangement of the traffic, would seem to assume that a
conveyance could be secured at any time of the day, for Mr.
Pickwick conveniently found one the instant he so abruptly
quitted Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s, while Winkle and his friends
just as conveniently found one immediately after breakfast.&nbsp;
He appears to have been seven hours on the road.&nbsp; But the
strong point on which all Ipswichians may rest secure is Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s statement to Mrs. Leo Hunter that Bury was
&ldquo;not many miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But an even more convincing proof can be found in
Jingle&rsquo;s relation to Eatanswill.&nbsp; He came over from
Bury to Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s party, leaving his servant there,
at the Hotel, and returned the same evening.&nbsp; The place must
have been but a short way off, when he could go and return in the
same day.&nbsp; Then what brought him to Eatanswill?&nbsp; We are
told that at the time he was courting Miss Nupkins, the
Mayor&rsquo;s daughter; of course, he rushed over in the hope of
meeting her at Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s
<i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>.&nbsp; Everything, therefore, fits
well together.</p>
<p>I thought of consulting the report of the House of Commons
Committee on the Election Petition, and this confirmed my
view.&nbsp; There great stress is laid on the Blue and Buff
colours: in both the report and the novel it is mentioned that
the constables&rsquo; staves were painted Blue.&nbsp; Boz makes
Bob Sawyer say, in answer to Potts&rsquo; horrified enquiry
&ldquo;Not Buff, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m a kind
of plaid at present&mdash;mixed colours&rdquo;&mdash;something
very like this he must have noticed in the Report.&nbsp; A
constable, asked was his comrade, one Seagrave, Buff, answered,
&ldquo;<i>well</i>, <i>half and half</i>, <i>I
believe</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the Report, voters were captured and
put to bed at the White Horse; and Sam tells how he &ldquo;pumped
over&rdquo; a number of voters at the same house.&nbsp; The very
waiter, who received Mr. Pickwick so contemptuously, was examined
by the Committee&mdash;his name was Henry Cowey&mdash;and he
answered exactly like the waiter with the
&ldquo;fortnight&rsquo;s napkin and the coeval
stockings.&rdquo;&nbsp; When asked &ldquo;was not
so-and-so&rsquo;s appearance that of an intoxicated
person?&rdquo; the language seemed too much for him, rather, he
took it to himself: &ldquo;If I <i>had</i> been intoxicated, I
could not have done my business.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is quite in
character.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Boz calls the inn at Eatanswill, &ldquo;The Town
Arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no such sign in all England at the
time, as the Road Book shows.&nbsp; Why then would he call the
White Horse by that name?&nbsp; The Town Arms of Ipswich have two
white <i>Sea Horses</i> as supporters.&nbsp; This had certainly
something to do with the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Pott was surely a real personage: for &ldquo;Boz,&rdquo;
who presently did not scruple to &ldquo;takeoff&rdquo; a living
Yorkshire schoolmaster in a fashion that all his neighbours and
friends recognised the original, would not draw back in the case
of an editor.&nbsp; Indeed, it is plain that in all points Pott
is truly an admirable figure, perfect in every point of view, and
finished.&nbsp; In fact, Pott and Pell, in their way, are the two
best pieces of work in the book.&nbsp; How admirable is the
description; &ldquo;a tall, thin man with a sandy-coloured head,
inclined to baldness, and a face in which solemn importance was
blended with a look of unfathomable profundity.&nbsp; He was
dressed in a long, brown surtout, with a black cloth waistcoat
and drab trousers.&nbsp; A double eye-glass dangled at his
waistcoat, and on his head he wore a very low-crowned hat with a
broad rim.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every touch is delightful&mdash;although
all is literal the literalness is all humour.&nbsp; As when Pott,
to recreate his guest, Mr. Pickwick, told Jane to &ldquo;go down
into the office and bring me up the file of the Gazette for
1828.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll read you just a few of the leaders I wrote
at that time upon the Buff job of appointing a new tollman to the
turnpike here.&nbsp; I rather think they&rsquo;ll amuse
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was rich enough, and he came back to the
same topic towards the end of the book.</p>
<p>It will be remembered Mr. Pott went to Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s
<i>F&ecirc;te</i> in the character of a Russian with a knout in
his hand.&nbsp; No doubt the Gazette had its &ldquo;eye on
Russia&rdquo; and like the famous <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> had
solemnly warned the Autocrat to that effect.&nbsp; It is, by the
way, amusing to find that this organ, <i>The Eagle</i> to wit,
which so increased the gaiety of the nation, has once more been
warning the Autocrat, and in a vein that proves that &ldquo;our
filthy contemporary,&rdquo; <i>The Eatanswill Gazette</i>, was no
exaggerated picture.&nbsp; This is how <i>The Eagle</i>, in a
late issue, speaks of the Russian occupation of Port
Arthur:&mdash;&ldquo;And once again that keen, fierce glance is
cast in the direction of the grasping Muscovite; again, one of
the foulest, <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>one of the vilest dynasties that has
impiously trampled on the laws of God, and has violated every
progressive aspiration the Almighty implanted in the human heart
when He fashioned man in His own image, and breathed into his
soul the breath of life, threatens, for the moment at least, to
put back the hands of the clock that tells the progress of
civilisation.&nbsp; The Emperor of all the Russias, this wicked
enemy of the human race, has succeeded in raising his hideous
flag on Port Arthur, and planting his iron heel and cloven hoof
on the heathen Chinese&mdash;filthy, degenerate creatures, who,
it must be admitted, are fitting companions for the
tallow-eating, &lsquo;knouting&rsquo; barbarian.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Nupkins and Magnus.</h3>
<p>Who was intended by Nupkins, the intolerable Mayor of
Ipswich?&nbsp; An odious being.&nbsp; We may wonder at
&ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s&rdquo; courage, for, of course, the existing
Mayor of Ipswich might think that the satire was pointed at
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; There can be little doubt, however, that
Nupkins was drawn from a London Police Magistrate, and is, in
fact, another portrait of the functionary whom he sketched
specially for &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo; under the name of Mr.
Fang.&nbsp; Nupkins, however, is more in the comedy
vein&mdash;ridiculed rather than gibbeted&mdash;than was Mr.
Fang.&nbsp; We have only to compare the touches in both
descriptions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon for interrupting
you,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;but before you proceed to
act upon any opinion you may have formed, I must claim my right
to be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said the magistrate,
peremptorily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must submit to you, sir&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, or I shall order an officer to remove
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may order your officers to do whatever you please,
sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare with this &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said Mr. Fang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word, and that
is I really never, without actual experience, could have
believed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Fang,
peremptorily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue this instant, or I&rsquo;ll have you
turned out of the office.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Mr. Pickwick, it will be remembered, made a
communication to Mr. Nupkins which changed the whole state of
affairs.&nbsp; Mr. Nupkins, with all his insolent despotism, was
held in check by conference with his clerk, Jinks, who kept him
from making mistakes by judicious hints.</p>
<p>Fang&rsquo;s clerk, like Mr. Jinks, interposed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How do you propose to deal with the case,
sir?&rdquo; inquired the clerk, in a low voice.</p>
<p>Mr. Jinks pulled him by the sleeve and whispered
something.&nbsp; He was evidently remonstrating.&nbsp; At length
the magistrate, gulping down with a very bad grace his
disinclination to hear anything more, said sharply, &ldquo;What
do you want to say?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Mr. Fang was about to commit Oliver, the Bookstall-keeper
rushed in, and insisted on being heard, and, like Mr. Nupkins,
Mr. Fang had to listen:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I demand to be sworn,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;I will not be put down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swear the man,&rdquo; growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill
grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, what have you got to say?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Mr. Nupkins said of Sam:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He is evidently a desperate
ruffian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is my servant, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is your servant, is he.&nbsp; A conspiracy to
defeat the ends of justice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare Fang and the Bookseller:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That book, is it paid for?&nbsp; No, it is
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I forgot all about it,&rdquo; exclaimed the
old gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice person to prepare a charge against a poor
boy,&rdquo; said Fang; &ldquo;the law will overtake you yet,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>In short, Nupkins is a softened edition of Fang.&nbsp; It was
curious that he turned out at the end not altogether so badly,
and there is certainly a little inconsistency in the
character.&nbsp; After Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s disclosures, he
becomes very rational and amiable.&nbsp; We may wonder, too, how
the latter could have accepted hospitality from, or have sat down
at the board of, the man who treated him in so gross a <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>fashion, and, further, that after accepting this
entertainment, Mr. Pickwick should take an heroic and injured
tone, recalling his injuries as he withdrew, but <i>after</i> his
dinner.</p>
<p>This magistrate was despotic enough, but we might have
expected that he would have had Mr. Peter Magnus brought before
him also, and have issued a warrant.&nbsp; The lady, however, was
silent as to her admirer, and this difficulty appears to have
occurred to the author for he makes Mr. Nupkins remark:
&ldquo;The other principal <i>you say</i> has absconded,&rdquo;
she having said nothing whatever.&nbsp; Being at the &ldquo;White
Horse,&rdquo; too, he was accessible.&nbsp; He may, however, have
gone off to secure &ldquo;a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Ipswich there is controversy as to the exact whereabouts of
his mansion.&nbsp; But there can be little doubt as to the
matter, as the directions given are minute.&nbsp; The guide books
take care to point it out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bending his steps towards
St. Clement&rsquo;s Church&rdquo;&mdash;that is leaving the
&ldquo;White Horse&rdquo; and following the street on the right,
&ldquo;he found himself in a retired spot, a kind of courtyard of
venerable appearance, which he discovered had no other outlet
than the turning by which he had entered.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe
it is the house at the far end of the lane&mdash;now Mr.
Bennett&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The street has been cut through the
lawn.&nbsp; There are here, as there were then, &ldquo;old red
brick houses&rdquo; and &ldquo;the green gate of a garden at the
bottom of the yard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing could be more precise,
allowing of course for the changes, demolitions, re-buildings,
&amp;c., of sixty years.</p>
<p>What became of Mr. Peter Magnus and his lady?&nbsp; Did they
&ldquo;make it up&rdquo;? or was Mr. Pickwick enabled to make
such explanations as would clear away all suspicions.&nbsp; Did
the two angry gentlemen meet again after Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
return to the &ldquo;White Horse?&rdquo;&nbsp; These are
interesting questions, and one at least can be answered.&nbsp;
Owing to an indiscretion of the foolish Winkle&rsquo;s, during
the famous action of Bardell v. Pickwick, we learn that Mr.
Pickwick &ldquo;being found in a lady&rsquo;s apartment at
midnight had led to the <i>breaking off of the projected
marriage</i> of the lady in question.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this seems
a serious result of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s indiscretion, and very
unfortunate for the poor lady, and ought to have caused him some
remorse.&nbsp; No doubt he explained the incident, which he had
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>better have done at first, for <i>now</i> it had the air
of attempting to shield the lady.&nbsp; It was odd that Mr.
Pickwick should thus have interfered with the marriage of
<i>two</i> elderly spinster ladies.</p>
<p>There is, by the way, a droll inconsistency on the part of the
author in his description of a scene between Mr. Magnus and Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; When the former was about to propose to the
middle-aged lady, he told Mr. Pickwick that he arranged to see
her at eleven.&nbsp; &ldquo;It only wants a quarter
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Breakfast was waiting, and the pair sat down to
it.&nbsp; Mr. Magnus was looking at the clock every other
second.&nbsp; Presently he announced, &ldquo;It only wants <i>two
minutes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this feverish
impatience, he asks Mr. Pickwick for his advice in proposing,
which the latter gave at great length.&nbsp; Mr. Magnus listened,
now without any impatience.&nbsp; The clock hand was
&ldquo;verging on the five minutes past;&rdquo; not until it was
<i>ten</i> minutes past did he rise.</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;Had Mr. Pickwick ever Loved?</h3>
<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s early history is obscure enough, and we
know no details save that he had been &ldquo;in
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; But had he ever an affair of the
heart?&nbsp; Just as in real life, when a stray allusion will
occasionally escape from a person betraying something of his past
history, so once or twice a casual remark of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
furnishes a hint.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Magnus, pressing him for his
advice in this delicate matter of proposing, asked him had he
ever done this sort of thing in his time.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean
proposing?&rdquo; said the great man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick,
<i>with great energy</i>, and then repeated the word
&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;&nbsp; His friend then assumed that he did
not know how it was best to begin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said
the other, cautiously, &ldquo;I may have formed some ideas on the
subject,&rdquo; but then added that he had &ldquo;never submitted
them to the test of experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is distinct
enough, but it does all the same hint at some <i>affaire de
c&oelig;ur</i>, else why would he &ldquo;have formed some ideas
upon the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, it may be that he was
thinking of Mrs. Bardell and her cruel charges.&nbsp; Still, it
was strange that a man should have reached to fifty, have grown
round and stout, without ever offering his hand.&nbsp; The first
picture in the book, however, helps us to speculate a
little.&nbsp; Over his head in the <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>room at
Dulwich hangs the portrait of an old lady in spectacles, the
image of the great Samuel; his mother certainly.&nbsp; He
evidently regarded her with deep affection, he had brought the
picture to Dulwich and placed it where it should always be before
his eyes.&nbsp; Could it not be, and is it not natural that in
addition to his other amiabilities he was the best of
sons&mdash;that she &ldquo;ruled the roast&rdquo;&mdash;that in
the old Mrs. Wardle, to whom he so filially attended, he saw his
mother&rsquo;s image, that she was with him to the day of her
death, and that while she lived, he resolved that no one else
should be mistress there!&nbsp; After her death he found himself
a confirmed old bachelor.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a speculation for
you on the German lines.</p>
<p>We might go on.&nbsp; This self denial must have been the more
meritorious as he was by nature of an affectionate, even amorous,
cast.&nbsp; He seized every opportunity of kissing the young
ladies.&nbsp; He would certainly have liked to have had some fair
being at home whom he could thus distinguish.&nbsp; How good this
description of the rogue&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick kissed the young
ladies&mdash;we were going to say as if they were his own
daughters, only, as he might possibly have infused <i>a little
more warmth into the salutation</i>, the comparison would not be
quite appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He never lost a chance.&nbsp; In the same spirit, when the
blushing Arabella came to tell of her marriage, &ldquo;can you
forgive my imprudence?&rdquo;&nbsp; He returned &ldquo;no verbal
response&rdquo;&mdash;not he&mdash;&ldquo;but <i>took off his
spectacles in great haste</i>, and seizing both the young
lady&rsquo;s hands in his, kissed her a great many
times&mdash;perhaps a greater number of times than was absolutely
necessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observe the artfulness of all
this&mdash;the deliberation&mdash;taking off the spectacles so
that they should not be in the way&mdash;seizing her
hands&mdash;and then setting to work!&nbsp; Oh, he knew more of
&ldquo;this sort of thing&rdquo; than he had credit for.&nbsp; He
had never proposed&mdash;true&mdash;but he had been near it a
precious sight more than he said.</p>
<p>Miss Witherfield is a rather mysterious personage, yet we take
an interest in her and speculate on her history.&nbsp; She lived
some twenty miles from Ipswich&mdash;no doubt at a family place
of her own.&nbsp; She had come in to stay at the White Horse for
the night and the morning.&nbsp; She was, no doubt, a person of
property&mdash;otherwise Mr. Magnus would <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>not have been
so eager, and he must have been a fortune hunter, for he confided
to Mr. Pickwick, that he had been jilted &ldquo;three or four
times.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a quaint notion by the way that of his:
&ldquo;I think an Inn is a good sort of place to propose to a
single woman in, Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; She is more likely to feel
the loneliness of her situation in travelling, perhaps than she
would be, at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find here some of the always amusing bits of confusion that
recur in the book.&nbsp; Here might be a Calverley question,
&ldquo;When was it, and where was it, that the Pickwickians had
<i>two</i> dinners in the one day?&rdquo;&nbsp; Answer: At the
Great White Horse on this very visit.&nbsp; When Mr. Nupkins
retired to lunch, after his interview with Miss Witherfield, the
Pickwickians sat down to their dinner &ldquo;quietly,&rdquo; and
were in the midst of that meal, when Grummer arrived to arrest
them.&nbsp; They were taken to Nupkins&rsquo;, and there dined
with him.&nbsp; This dinner would have brought them to five
o&rsquo;clock:&mdash;we are told of candles&mdash;so that it was
dark&mdash;yet this was the month of May, when it would been
light enough till eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Mrs. Nupkins&rsquo;
dress, on coming in from lunch, is worth noting.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
blue gauze turban and a light brown wig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, it was to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s watch, that we owe the
diverting and farcical incident of the double bedded
bedroom&mdash;and indeed we have here all the licensed
improbabilities of a Farce.&nbsp; To forget his watch on a hotel
table was the last thing a staid man of business would do.&nbsp;
How could he be made to forget it?&nbsp; &ldquo;By winding it
up,&rdquo; said the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;Winding up his watch,
and <i>laying it on the table</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was of
course in the <i>Fob</i> days, when the watch had to be drawn
from the deep pocket; not as now when it is secured with a
&ldquo;guard chain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Naturally, he might in an
abstracted moment have so laid it down.</p>
<p>As an instance of the natural, every-day sort of tone
prevailing through the book, it may be noted that it is mentioned
as a matter of history, that the breakfast next day was at eleven
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a late hour.&nbsp; But we know, though it is
not pointed out, that Mr. Magnus and Mr. Pickwick had sat till
morning drinking brandy and water, and that Mr. Pickwick had
spent a portion of the night wandering about the Hotel.&nbsp;
Naturally he came down late.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>We are also minutely told that Mr. Magnus left the room
at ten minutes past eleven.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick &ldquo;took a few
strides to and fro,&rdquo; when it became half past eleven!&nbsp;
But this is a rather mysterious passage, for we next learn that
&ldquo;the <i>small hand</i> of the clock, following the
<i>latter part</i> of his example, had arrived at the figure
which indicates the half hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;latter
part,&rdquo; would refer to &ldquo;fro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps it
is a fresh gibe at the unlucky White Horse and its
administration.&nbsp; The &ldquo;small hand,&rdquo; in any case,
could not, and would not, point to the half hour, save that it
had got loosened, and had jumped down, as hands will do, to seek
the centre of gravity.</p>
<p>How natural, too, is the appearance of Jingle.&nbsp; With
Wardles&rsquo; &pound;120 in his pocket, he was flush of cash,
and could make a new appearance&mdash;in a new district&mdash;as
an officer&mdash;Captain FitzMarshall.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;picked
up,&rdquo; we are told, at some neighbouring races.&nbsp; Sudbury
and Stowmarket are not far off.</p>
<p>Some years ago, the late Lady Quain was staying at Ipswich and
took so deep an interest in the &ldquo;Great White Horse&rdquo;
and its traditions that she had it with all its apartments
photographed on a large scale, forming a regular series.&nbsp;
Her husband, the amiable physician whose loss we have to deplore,
gave them to me.&nbsp; The &ldquo;White Horse&rdquo; was
decidedly wrong in having Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s double-bedded room
fitted up with brass Birmingham bedsteads.&nbsp; Were I the
proprietor I would assuredly have the room arranged exactly as in
Phiz&rsquo;s picture&mdash;the two old-fashioned four-posts with
the dimity curtains, the rush light and shade on the floor, the
old glass on the dressing-table.&nbsp; To be even more realistic
still there might be added Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s night-capped head
peeping out, and the lean presentment of the lady herself, all,
say, in wax, <i>&agrave; la Tussaud</i>.&nbsp; What a show and
attraction that would be!</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s ingenuity was never at fault in the face of
a difficulty.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick was to be got to Nupkins&rsquo;
in a sedan chair, a grotesque incident; but then, what to do with
Tupman, also arrested?&nbsp; As both would not fit in an ordinary
sedan, the sedan was made to fit <i>them</i>, and thus it was
done.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was recollected that there stood in the Inn
yard an old sedan chair, which, having been originally built for
a gouty gentleman with funded property, would hold Mr. <!-- page
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Pickwick and Mr. Tupman at least as conveniently as a
modern postchaise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing is more remarkable than the ingenious and striking
fashion in which &ldquo;<i>Boz</i>&rdquo; has handled the episode
of the double-bedded room and the yellow curl papers.&nbsp; The
subject was an awkward one and required skilful management, or it
might have repelled.&nbsp; The problem was how to make the
situation amusing and yet not too realistic?&nbsp; It will be
seen that all the <i>appearances</i> of a most embarrassing
situation are produced, and yet really neither the lady nor Mr.
Pickwick have taken off their garments.&nbsp; To produce this
result, much elaborate machinery was requisite.&nbsp; The beds
were arranged as if on the stage, one on each side of the door
with a sort of little lane between the wall and each bed.&nbsp;
Mr. Pickwick, we are told, actually crept into this lane, got to
the end where there was a chair, and in this straight, confined
situation proceeded to take off his coat and vest and to fold
them up.&nbsp; It was thus artfully brought about that he
appeared to have gone to bed, and could look out from the dimity
curtains without having done so.&nbsp; It does not strike every
one that Mr. Pickwick, under ordinary circumstances, would have
taken off his &ldquo;things&rdquo; before the fire just as the
lady did, in the free and open space, and not huddled up in a
dark corner.&nbsp; However, as Mr. Weller says: &ldquo;It wos to
be, and&mdash;it wos,&rdquo; or we should have had no story and
no laugh.</p>
<p>There is a pleasant story&mdash;quite akin to Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s adventure&mdash;of what befell Thackeray when
travelling in America.&nbsp; Going up to bed, he mistook the
floor, and entered a room the very counterpart of his own.&nbsp;
He had begun to take off his clothes, when a soft voice came from
within&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Is that you</i>,
<i>George</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; In a panic, he bundled up his things,
like Mr. Pickwick, and hurriedly rushed out, thinking what would
be the confusion should he encounter &ldquo;George&rdquo; at the
door.&nbsp; Anthony Trollope, my old, pleasant friend and sponsor
at the Garrick Club, used to relate another of these hotel
misadventures which, he protested, was the most
&ldquo;side-splitting&rdquo; thing ever he heard of.&nbsp; A
gentleman who was staying at one of the monster Paris hotels with
his lady, was seized with some violent cold or pulmonary
attack.&nbsp; She went down to try and get him a mustard plaster,
which, <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>with much difficulty, she
contrived.&nbsp; Returning in triumph, as Mr. Pickwick did with
his recovered watch, she found that he had fallen into a gentle
sleep, and was lying with his head buried in the pillows.&nbsp;
With much softness and deftness, she quickly drew away the
coverings, and, without disturbing him, managed to insinuate the
plaster into its proper place.&nbsp; Having done her duty, she
then proceeded to lie down, when the sleeping man, moving
uneasily, awoke and showed his face.&nbsp; It was <i>not</i> her
husband!&nbsp; She fled from the room.&nbsp; The humour of the
thing&mdash;as described by Trollope&mdash;was the bewilderment
of the man on discovering the damp and burning mass that had been
applied to him, and the amazing disappearance of his
visitant.&nbsp; What did it all mean?&nbsp; The mystery probably
remained unsolved to the day of his death.</p>
<p>But the Great White Horse received an important cosmopolitan
compliment from across the seas&mdash;at the Chicago
Exhibition&mdash;when a large and complete model was prepared and
set up in the building.&nbsp; This was an elaborate as well as
important tribute to the Book which it was assumed that every one
knew by heart.</p>
<h3>V.&mdash;Ipswich Theatre</h3>
<p>Boz, on his travels, with his strong theatrical taste, was
sure to have gone to the little theatre in Tacket Street, now a
Salvation Army meeting-house.&nbsp; It is the same building,
though much altered and pulled about, as that in which David
Garrick made his first appearance on the stage, as Mr. Lyddal,
about 150 years ago.&nbsp; I have before me now a number of
Ipswich play bills, dated in the year 1838, just after the
conclusion of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; and which, most
appropriately, seem to record little but Boz&rsquo;s own
work.&nbsp; Pickwick, Oliver, Nickleby, and others, are the Bill
of Fare, and it may be conceived that audiences would attend to
see their own Great White Horse, and the spinster lady in her
curl papers, and Mr. Nupkins, the Mayor, brought on the
boards.&nbsp; These old strips of tissue paper have a strange
interest; they reflect the old-fashioned theatre and audiences;
and the Pickwickian names of the characters, so close after the
original appearance, have a greater reality.&nbsp; Here, for
instance, is a programme for Mr. Gill&rsquo;s benefit, on <!--
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>January 19, 1839, when we had &ldquo;The Pickwickians at
half-price.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was &ldquo;a comic drama, in three
acts, exhibiting the life and manners of the present day,
entitled&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Pickwick</span>, or the sayings and doings of Sam
Weller!&rdquo;<br />
<i>Adapted expressly for this Theatre from the celebrated
Pickwick Papers</i>,<br />
<i>by Boz</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present drama of Pickwick has been honoured by
crowded houses, and greeted by shouts of laughter and reiterated
peals of applause upon every representation, and has been
acknowledged by the public Press to be the only successful
adaptation.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Illustrations</span> designed and
executed by popular <span class="smcap">Phiz-es</span>.</p>
<p>The new music by Mr. Pindar.&nbsp; The quadrilles under the
direction of Mr. Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the characters are given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pickwick,&rdquo; founder of the Club, and
travelling the counties of Essex and Suffolk in pursuit of
knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snodgrass,&rdquo; a leetle bit of a poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winkle,&rdquo; a corresponding member also; and a
something of a sportsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Job Trotter,&rdquo; thin plant o&rsquo; ooman natur;
something between a servant and a friend to Jingle; a kind of
perambulating hydraulic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; a fat boy, addicted to cold pudding and
snoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Rachel Wardle,&rdquo; in love with Jingle or
anybody else that will have her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emily&rdquo; was appropriately represented in such a
Theatre, by Miss Garrick.</p>
<p>The scenes are laid at first at the Red Lion, Colchester,
close by which is Manor Farm, where a ball is given, and, of
course, &ldquo;the Pickwickian Quadrilles!&rdquo; are danced
&ldquo;as performed at the Nobility&rsquo;s Balls.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(I have these quadrilles, with Mr. Pickwick, on the title.)&nbsp;
Then comes the White Hart, and &ldquo;How they make
sausages!&rdquo; displayed in large type.&nbsp; The scene is then
shifted to the Angel, at Bury, and the double-bedded room with
its &ldquo;horrible dilemma,&rdquo; and</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Scene of
Night Caps</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be noticed that there is nothing of the Great White
Horse in the very town.&nbsp; The reason was that the proprietor
was disgusted <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>by the unflattering account given of
his Inn and must have objected.&nbsp; It winds up with the Fleet
scenes, where Mr. Weller, senr.,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Arrests
his own Offspring</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That this notion of the Great White Horse being sulky and
hostile is the true one is patent from another bill, December 10,
1843, some four years later, when the proprietor allowed his Inn
to be introduced.&nbsp; The piece was called&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Boots at
the White Horse</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now acting in London with extraordinary
success.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was, of course, our old friend
&ldquo;Boots at the Swan,&rdquo; which Frank Robson, later, made
his own.&nbsp; As Boz had nothing to do with it, there could be
no objection.&nbsp; Barnaby Rudge, however, was the piece of
resistance.&nbsp; On another occasion, January, 1840, came Mr. J.
Russell, with his vocal entertainment, &ldquo;Russell&rsquo;s
Recollections&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Portrait from the Pickwick
Gallery.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you seen him?&nbsp;
Alphabetical Distinctions.&nbsp; A sample of <span
class="smcap">Mister Sam Weller&rsquo;s</span> Descriptive
Powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some adaptation or other of Dickens seems to have been always
the standing dish.&nbsp; The old Ipswich Theatre is certainly an
interesting one, and Garrick and Boz are names to conjure
with.</p>
<h3>VI.&mdash;Who was Pott?</h3>
<p>There have been abundant speculations as to the originals of
the Pickwickian characters&mdash;some Utopian enough, but I do
not think that any have been offered in the case of Mr. Pott, the
redoubtable editor of the <i>Eatanswill Gazette</i>.&nbsp; I am
inclined to believe that the notorious and brilliant Dr. Maginn
was intended.&nbsp; He and Pott were both distinguished for their
&ldquo;slogging&rdquo; or bludgeoning articles, and both were
High Tories, or &ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; as Mr. Pott had it.&nbsp; But
what is most significant is that in the very year Pickwick was
coming out, to wit, 1836, Maginn had attracted general attention
and reprobation by the scandal of his duel with Grantley Berkely,
arising out of a most scurrilous review of the latter&rsquo;s
novel.&nbsp; To this meeting he had been brought with some
difficulty&mdash;just as Pott&mdash;the
&ldquo;Pot-valiant,&rdquo; declined to &ldquo;serve him
so,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, Slurk; being restrained by the laws of
his country.&nbsp; He was an assistant editor to the
&ldquo;Standard,&rdquo; and had <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>furnished
scurrilites to the &ldquo;John Bull.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had about
this time also obtained an influence over the interesting
&ldquo;L. E. L.,&rdquo; whom John Forster, it is known, was
&ldquo;courting,&rdquo; and by some rumours and machinations
succeeded in breaking off the business.&nbsp; Now Forster and
Boz, at the time, were bosom friends&mdash;Forster could be
unsparing enough where he was injured: and how natural that his
new friend should share his enmities.&nbsp; Boz was always glad
to gibbet a notorious public abuse, and here was an
opportunity.&nbsp; Maginn&rsquo;s friend, Kenealey, wrote to an
American, who was about to edit Maginn&rsquo;s writings,
&ldquo;You have a glorious opportunity, where you have no fear of
libel before your eyes.&nbsp; <i>Maginn&rsquo;s best things can
never be published till his victims have passed from the
scene</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; How significant is this!&nbsp; Then
Pott&rsquo;s &ldquo;combining his information,&rdquo; his
&ldquo;cramming&rdquo; critic, his using the lore of the
Encyclopedia Britannica for his articles suggest Maginn&rsquo;s
classical lucubrations.&nbsp; A well-known eminent
<i>Litt&eacute;rateur</i>, to whom I suggested this view,
objected that Pott is not shown to be such a blackguard as
Maginn, and that Maginn was not such an ass as Pott.&nbsp; But
Boz generalised his borrowed originals.&nbsp; Skimpole was taken
from Leigh Hunt, yet was represented as a sort of scoundrel; and
Boz confessed that he only adapted his lighter manner and airy
characteristics.</p>
<p>In these latter days, people have been somewhat astonished by
the strange &ldquo;freak&rdquo; of our leading journal in so
persistently offering and pressing on the public their venture of
a new edition of the Encyclopedia.&nbsp; Every ingenious
variation of bold advertisement is used to tempt the
purchaser&mdash;a sovereign down and time for the rest; actual
pictures of the whole series of volumes; impassioned arguments,
pleadings, and an appeal to take it at the most wonderfully low
price.&nbsp; Then we have desirable information, dealing with
topics of varied kind, and assurances that material would here be
found for dealing conveniently with every known subject.&nbsp;
Still, what a surprise that use was not made of &ldquo;the
immortal Pickwick&rdquo; in whose pages these peculiar advantages
were more successfully and permanently set forth and illustrated
by one most telling example furnished by no other than Mr. Pott
himself, the redoubtable editor of the <i>Eatanswill
Gazette</i>.&nbsp; To him and to no other is due the credit of
being the first to show <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>practically <i>how to use</i> the
Encyclopedia.&nbsp; He has furnished a <i>principle</i> which is
worth all the lengthy exhortations of the <i>Times</i>
itself.</p>
<p>Pott seems to have kept the work in his office, and to have
used it for his articles in a highly ingenious fashion.&nbsp; For
three months had he been supplying a series of papers, which he
assures us &ldquo;appeared at intervals,&rdquo; and which excited
&ldquo;such general&mdash;I may say, such universal attention and
admiration.&rdquo;&nbsp; A fine tribute surely to the
Encyclopedia.&nbsp; For recollect Pott&rsquo;s was a
newspaper.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> folk say nothing of this
important view.&nbsp; Poor, simple Mr. Pickwick had not seen the
articles because he was busy travelling about and had no time for
reading.&nbsp; (Probably Pott would have put him on the
&ldquo;free list&rdquo; of his paper, but for the awkward Winkle
flirtation which broke up the intimacy).&nbsp; Nay, he might have
had &ldquo;the revolving book case,&rdquo; which would handily
contain <i>all</i> the volumes.</p>
<p>And what were these articles?&nbsp; &ldquo;They appeared in
the form of a <i>copious</i>&rdquo;&mdash;mark the
word!&mdash;&ldquo;review of a work on Chinese
Metaphysics.&rdquo;&nbsp; It had need to be copious therefor, for
it is a very large subject.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick himself must have
been very familiar with the Encyclopedia, for he at once objected
that he was not aware that so abstruse a topic was dealt with in
its pages.&nbsp; He had perhaps consulted the book, say, at
Garraway&rsquo;s Coffee House, for, alas! the good man was not
able to have a library of his own, living, as he did, in lodgings
or at the &ldquo;George and Vulture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pott,
however, who also knew the work well, had then to confess that
there was no such subject treated separately in it.&nbsp; But the
articles were from the pen of his critic (not from his own),
&ldquo;who <i>crammed</i> for it, to use a technical but
expressive term; he read up for the subject, at my desire, in the
Encyclopedia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as the subject was <i>not</i> treated in the work, how
could this &ldquo;cramming&rdquo; help him?&nbsp; Here comes in
the system, so unaccountably overlooked by the <i>Times</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Combination Method.&nbsp; &ldquo;He read,
sir,&rdquo; rejoined Pott, laying his hand on Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s knee and looking round with a smile of
intellectual superiority, &ldquo;he read for metaphysics under
the letter <i>M</i>, and for China under the letter <i>C</i>, and
<i>combined his information</i>, <i>sir</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
we have it!&nbsp; We find separate articles <i>De </i><!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span><i>omni scribili</i>, and many topics unavoidably passed
over; but we see how this can be cured by the ingenious Pott
system.&nbsp; Combine your information!&nbsp; There you
are!&nbsp; Here for instance&mdash;under
&ldquo;Metaphysics&rdquo; we do find something about&rsquo;
Confucius and the other Pundits; we then turn to China and get
local colour, Chinese writers. &amp;c., and then proceed
&ldquo;to combine our information.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so with
hundreds of other instances and other topics.&nbsp; Pott,
therefore, has been overlooked by the managers of the
<i>Times</i>, but it is not yet too late for them to call
attention to his system.&nbsp; It is of interest to all at
Eatanswill.</p>
<p>Pott was in advance of his time.&nbsp; His paper was not
wholly the sort of scurrilous organ it has been shown to
be.&nbsp; To weight its columns with &ldquo;Chinese
Metaphysics,&rdquo; was a bold, reforming step&mdash;then the
going on for three months, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>twelve</i>
articles&mdash;and all read with avidity.&nbsp; And what are we
to think of the Eatanswill readers&mdash;surely in advance,
too.&nbsp; And here we have him, nearly seventy years ago, giving
a well-deserved puff to the Encyclopedia, which is really worth
the innumerable columns the leading journal has devoted to the
book.&nbsp; Its last effort was to show an ingenious connection
between the British Association and the Encyclopedia, on the
ground of its various Presidents.&nbsp; &ldquo;It stimulates, in
fact creates, the necessity for a good working Library of
Science.&nbsp; It is here that the Encyclopedia comes in as of
especial service.&rdquo;</p>

24</span>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; BATH</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;The Old City</h3>
<p>Bath, which already owed so much to famous writers, was
destined to owe even more to Boz, the genial author of
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;&mdash;a book which has so much increased
the gaiety of the nation.&nbsp; The scenes at the old city are
more minute and vivid than any yet offered.&nbsp; But, if it owe
much to Boz, it repaid him by furnishing him with a name for his
book which has gone over the world.&nbsp; Everything about this
name will be interesting; and it is not generally known when and
how Boz obtained it.</p>
<p>There is a small hamlet some few miles from Bath and 97 from
London&mdash;which is 106 miles away from Bath&mdash;bearing the
name of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bath coach, by the way,
started from the White Horse Cellars, Piccadilly, at half-past
seven in the morning, and took just twelve hours for the
journey.&nbsp; Now it is made by the Great Western in two!&nbsp;
Here, many years ago, at the time of the story, was
&ldquo;Pickwick House, the seat of C. N. Loscombe, Esq.,&rdquo;
and also &ldquo;Pickwick Lodge,&rdquo; where dwelt Captain
Fenton.&nbsp; Boz had never seen or heard of such places, but all
the same they indirectly furnished him with the name.&nbsp; A
mail-coach guard found an infant on the road in this place, and
gave it the name of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; contains the common terminal
&ldquo;wick,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;Warwick,&rdquo; and which means
a village or hamlet of some kind.&nbsp; Pickwick, however, has
long since disappeared from the face of the map.&nbsp; Probably,
after the year 1837, folk did not relish dating their letters
from a spot of such humorous memories.</p>
<p>This Moses Pickwick was taken into the service of the coaching
hotel, the White Hart, gradually devoted himself to the horse and
coaching business, and, at the time of Boz&rsquo;s or Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s visit, was the actual proprietor of the coaches
on the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;The name,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;is
not only down on the vay-bill, sir, but they&rsquo;ve <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>painted vun on &rsquo;em on the door of the
coach.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Sam spoke he pointed to that part of the
door on which the proprietor&rsquo;s name usually appears, and
there, sure enough, in gilt letters of a goodly size, was the
magic name of <span class="smcap">Pickwick</span>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, quite staggered by the
coincidence, &ldquo;what a very extraordinary thing!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes; but that ain&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said Sam, again
directing his master&rsquo;s attention to the coach-door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not content with writin&rsquo; up &lsquo;Pickwick,&rsquo;
they put &lsquo;Moses&rsquo; afore it, which I calls adding
insult to injury.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd enough,
certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; When he was casting
about for a good name for his venture, it recurred to him as
having a quaint oddity and uncanniness.&nbsp; And thus it is that
we owe to Bath, and to Bath only, this celebrated name.&nbsp; It
is said that he rushed into the publisher&rsquo;s office,
exultingly proclaiming his selection.</p>
<p>Few cities have had their society and manners sketched by such
eminent pens as Bath&mdash;Smollett, Miss Burney, Miss Austen,
and Boz.&nbsp; The old walls and houses are thus made to
live.&nbsp; Boz has given one of the most vivid and vivacious
pictures of its expiring glories in the thirties, when there were
still &ldquo;M.C.s,&rdquo; routs, assemblies, and sedans.&nbsp;
His own connection with the place is a personal, and a very
interesting one.&nbsp; He was there in 1835 on election business
hurrying after Lord John Russell, all over the country, to report
his speeches&mdash;a young fellow of three and twenty, full of
&ldquo;dash,&rdquo; &ldquo;go,&rdquo; and readiness of resource,
of immense energy and carelessness of fatigue, ready to go
anywhere and do anything.&nbsp; While thus engaged on serious
business, he kept his eyes wide open, took in all the humours of
Bath, and noted them in his memory, though he made no use of this
till more than two years later, when he was well on into
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entering an old city by night always leaves a curious
romantic impression, and few old cities gain so much as Bath by
this mode of approach.&nbsp; The shadowy houses have a monumental
air; the fine streets which we mostly ascend show a mystery,
especially as we flit by the open square, under the great, black
Abbey, which seems a beetling rock.&nbsp; This old Bath
mysteriousness seems haunted by the ghosts of Burney, Johnson,
Goldsmith, Wilkes, Quin, Thrale, <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Mr. Pickwick,
and dozens more.&nbsp; Fashion and gentilily hover round its
stately homes.&nbsp; Nothing rouses such ideas of state and
dignity as the Palladian Circus.&nbsp; There is a tone of
mournful grandeur about it&mdash;something forlorn.&nbsp; Had it,
in some freak of fashion, been abandoned, and suffered, for a
time at least, to go to neglect and be somewhat overgrown with
moss and foliage, it would pass for some grand Roman ruin.&nbsp;
There is a solemn, greyish gloom about it; the grass in the
enclosure is rank, long, and very green.&nbsp; Pulteney Street,
too: what a state and nobility there is about it!&nbsp; So wide
and so spacious; the houses with an air of grand solidity, with
no carvings or frittering work, but relying on their fine lines
and proportion.&nbsp; To lodge there is an education, and the
impression remains with one as of a sense of personal dignity
from dwelling in such large and lofty chambers, grandly laid out
with noble stairs and the like.&nbsp; The builders in this fine
city would seem to have been born architects; nearly all the
houses have claims to distinction: each an expression and feeling
of its own.&nbsp; The fine blackened or browned tint adds to the
effect.&nbsp; The mouldings are full of reserve and chastened,
suited exactly to the material.&nbsp; There is something, too,
very stately about the octagon Laura Place, which opens on to
Pulteney Street.</p>
<p>In this point of view Bath is a more interesting city than
Edinburgh.&nbsp; Mr. Peach has written two most interesting
little quartos on the &ldquo;Historic Houses of Bath;&rdquo; and
Mr. T. Sturge Cotterell has prepared a singularly interesting map
of Bath, in which all the spots honoured by the residence of
famous visitors are marked down.&nbsp; It is very extraordinary
the number and distinction of these personages.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything more strange and agreeable than
the feeling of promenading the Parades, North and South&mdash;a
feeling compounded of awe, reverence, and exciting
interest.&nbsp; The tranquil repose and dignity of these low,
solid houses, the broad flagged Promenade, the unmistakable air
of old fashion, the sort of reality and self-persuasion that they
might in a moment be re-peopled with all these eminent
persons&mdash;much as Boz called up the ghosts of the old
mail-coach passengers in his telling ghost story&mdash;the sombre
grey of the walls, the brightness of the windows: these elements
join to leave an extraordinary impression.&nbsp; The houses on
these Parades <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>are charming from their solid
proportions, adapted, as it were, to the breadth of the
Parade.&nbsp; Execrable, by the way, are the modern attempts seen
side by side; feeble and incapable, not attempting any expression
at all.&nbsp; There is a row of meagre tenements beside the
Abbey&mdash;attempts at pinnacled gables&mdash;which it is a
sorrowful thing to look on, so cheap and starved is it.&nbsp;
Even the newer shops, in places like Milsom Street, with nothing
to do but to copy what is before them, show the same
<i>platitude</i>.&nbsp; Here and there you are constantly coming
upon one of these beautifully designed old mansions piteously
disguised, cut up in two or three it may be, or the lower portion
fashioned into a shop.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;The Pump Room and Assembly Rooms</h3>
<p>No group of architectural objects is more effective or touches
one more nearly than the buildings gathered about the
Baths.&nbsp; There is something quaint and old-fashioned in the
arrangement, and I am never tired of coming back to the pretty,
open colonnade, the faded yet dignified Pump-room, with the
ambitious hotel and the solemn Abbey rising solemnly
behind.&nbsp; Then there is the delightful Promenade opposite,
under the arcades&mdash;a genuine bit of old fashion&mdash;under
whose shadow the capricious Fanny Burney had often
strolled.&nbsp; Everything about this latter
conglomeration&mdash;the shape of the ground, the knowledge that
the marvellous Roman baths are below, and even the older portion
of the municipal buildings whose elegant decorations, sculptured
garlands, &amp;c., bespeak the influence of the graceful Adam,
whose pupil or imitator Mr. Baldwin may have been.</p>
<p>Boz&rsquo;s description of the tarnished Pump-room answers to
what is seen now, save as to the tone of the decorations.&nbsp; I
say &ldquo;Boz&rsquo;s,&rdquo; for Pickwick, it should be
recollected, was not actually acknowledged by the author, under
his proper name.&nbsp; It was thought that the well-known and
popular &ldquo;Boz&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Sketches&rdquo; would
attract far more than the obscure C. Dickens.&nbsp; Now Boz and
the Sketches have receded and are little thought of.&nbsp; Boz
and Pickwick go far better together than do Pickwick and
Dickens.&nbsp; There is an old-fashioned solemnity over this
Pump-room which speaks of the old classical taste <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>over
a hundred years ago.&nbsp; How quaint and suitable the
inscription,
&ldquo;&rsquo;&Alpha;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&nu;
y&epsilon;&nu; &upsilon;&delta;&omicron;&rho;,&rdquo; in faded
gilt characters.&nbsp; Within it is one stately chamber, not
altered a bit since the day, sixty-three years ago, that Boz
strolled in and wrote this inscription: As I sat with a friend
beside me in the newly finished concert-room, which is in
<i>happy</i> keeping, I called up the old genial Pickwick
promenading about under the direction of Bantam, M.C., and the
genial tone of the old gaiety and good spirits.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Tompion Clock,&rdquo; which is carefully noted by
Boz, seems to have been always regarded as a sort of
monument.&nbsp; It is like an overgrown eight-day clock, without
any adornment and plain to a degree&mdash;no doubt relying upon
its Tompion works.&nbsp; It is in exactly the same place as it
was over sixty years ago, and goes with the old regularity.&nbsp;
Nay, for that matter, it stands where it did a hundred years
ago&mdash;in the old recess by Nash&rsquo;s statue and
inscription, and was no doubt ordered at the opening of the
rooms.&nbsp; In an old account of Bath, at the opening of the
century, attention is called to the Tompion clock with a sort of
pride.&nbsp; The steep and shadowy Gay Street, which leads up to
the inviting Crescent and the more sombre Queen&rsquo;s Square,
affects one curiously.&nbsp; Then we come to the old Assembly
Rooms close by the Circus, between Alfred Street and Bennell
Street&mdash;a stately, dignified pile&mdash;in the good old
classical style of Bath.&nbsp; One looks on it with a mysterious
reverence: it seems charged with all sorts of memories of old,
bygone state.&nbsp; For here all the rank and fashion of Bath
used to make its way of Assembly nights.&nbsp; Many years ago,
there was here given a morning concert to which I found my way,
mainly for the purpose of calling up ghostly memories of the
Thrales, and Doctor Johnson, and Miss Burney, and, above all, of
Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; Though the music was the immortal
&ldquo;Passion&rdquo; of Bach, my eyes were travelling all the
while from one piece of faded <i>rococo</i> work and
decoration.&nbsp; Boz never fails to secure the <i>tone</i> of
any strange place he is describing.&nbsp; We all, for instance,
have that pleased, elated feeling on the first morning after our
arrival over night at a new place&mdash;the general brightness,
surprise, and air of novelty.&nbsp; We are willing to be pleased
with everything, and pass from object to object with
enjoyment.&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Now all this is difficult to seize or
to describe.&nbsp; Boz does not do the latter, but he conveys it
perfectly.&nbsp; We see the new arrivals seated at breakfast, and
the entrance of the Dowlers with the M.C., and the party setting
off to see the &ldquo;Lions,&rdquo; the securing tickets for the
Assembly, the writing down their names in &ldquo;the book,&rdquo;
Sam sent specially up to Queen&rsquo;s Square, and so on.&nbsp;
All which is very exhilarating, and reveals one&rsquo;s own
feeling on such an occasion.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Pump-room
books&rdquo; are formally mentioned in the regulations.&nbsp; We
can see the interior of the Assembly Rooms in Phiz&rsquo;s plate,
with its huge and elaborately framed oval mirrors and
chandeliers&mdash;the dancing-room set round with raised
benches.&nbsp; After the pattern of Ridotto rooms abroad, there
were the card-rooms and tea-rooms, where Mr. Pickwick played
whist with Miss Bolo.&nbsp; We note the sort of Adam or
Chippendale chair on which the whist Dowager is sitting with her
back to us.</p>
<p>Considering that the rules of dress were so strict, pumps and
silk stockings being of necessity, we may wonder how it was that
the President of the Pickwick Club was admitted in his morning
dress, his kerseymere tights, white waistcoat, and black
gaiters.&nbsp; It is clear that he never changed his dress for
evening parties, save on one occasion.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
costume was certainly in defiance of all rules and
regulations.&nbsp; It is <i>laid</i> in the regulations of Mr.
Tyson, M.C., who directed that &ldquo;no gentleman in boots or
half-boots be admitted into the rooms on ball nights or card
nights.&rdquo;&nbsp; Half-boots might certainly cover Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s gaiters.&nbsp; So accurate is the picture that
speculation arises whether Phiz went specially to Bath to make
his sketches; for he has caught in the most perfect way the whole
<i>tone</i> of a Bath Assembly, and he could not have obtained
this from descriptions by others.&nbsp; So, too, with this
picture of the Circus in Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
<i>escapade</i>.&nbsp; It will be remembered that Boz was rather
particular about this picture, and suggested some minute
alterations.&nbsp; Bantam, the M.C., or &ldquo;the Grand
Master&rdquo; as Boz oddly calls him, was drawn from life from an
eccentric functionary named Jervoise.&nbsp; I have never been
quite able to understand his odd hypothesis about Mr. Pickwick
being &ldquo;the gentleman who had the waters bottled and sent to
Clapham.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how characteristic the dialogue on the
occasion!&nbsp; It will be seen that <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>this M.C.
cannot credit the notion of anyone of such importance as Mr.
Pickwick &ldquo;never having been in <i>Ba-ath</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His ludicrous and absurd, &ldquo;Not bad&mdash;not bad!&nbsp;
Good&mdash;good.&nbsp; He, he, re-markable!&rdquo; showed how it
struck him.&nbsp; A man of such a position, too; it was
incredible.&nbsp; With a delightful sense of this theory, he
began: &ldquo;It is long&mdash;<i>very long</i>, Mr. Pickwick,
<i>since you drank the waters</i>&mdash;it appears an
age.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick protested that it was certainly
long since he had drunk the waters, and his proof was that he had
never been in Bath in his life.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s
reflection the M.C. saw the solution.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I see;
yes, yes; good, good; better and better.&nbsp; You are the
gentleman residing on Clapham Green who lost the use of your
limbs from imprudently taking cold <i>after port wine</i>, who
could not be moved in consequence of acute suffering, and who had
the water from the King&rsquo;s Bath bottled at 103 degrees and
sent by waggon to his bed-room in town, where he bathed, sneezed,
and same day recovered.&rdquo;&nbsp; This amusing concatenation
is, besides, an admirable and very minute stroke of character,
and the frivolous M.C. is brought before us perfectly.&nbsp;
While a capital touch is that when he saw young Mr. Mutanhead
approaching.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush! draw a little nearer, Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; You see that splendidly dressed young man coming
this way&mdash;the richest young man in Bath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>, <i>you&rsquo;ll hear his voice in a
moment</i>, <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>.&nbsp; <i>He&rsquo;ll speak to
me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Particular</i> awe and reverence could
not be better expressed.</p>
<p>It is curious how accurate the young fellow was in all his
details.&nbsp; He describes the ball as beginning at
&ldquo;precisely twenty minutes before eight
o&rsquo;clock;&rdquo; and according to the old rules it had to
begin as soon after seven as possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay in the
tea room and take your sixpennorths.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Dowler&rsquo;s advice was after a regulation &ldquo;that everyone
admitted to the tea-rooms on dress nights shall pay <i>6d.</i>
for tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The M.C.&rsquo;s visit to Mr. Pickwick was
a real carrying out of the spirit of the regulations, in which it
was requested that &ldquo;all strangers will give the M.C. an
opportunity of being introduced to them before they themselves
are entitled to that attention and respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing is more gratifying to the genuine Pickwickians than to
find how all these old memories of the book are fondly cherished
in <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>the good city.&nbsp; All the Pickwickian localities are
identified, and the inhabitants are eager in every way to
maintain that Mr. Pickwick belongs to them, and had been with
them.&nbsp; We should have had his room in the White Hart pointed
out, and &ldquo;slept in&rdquo; by Americans and others, had it
still been left to stand.&nbsp; Not long since, the writer went
down to the good old city for the pleasant duty of
&ldquo;preaching Pickwick,&rdquo; as he had done in a good many
places.&nbsp; There is an antique building or temple not far from
where an old society of the place&mdash;the Bath Literary and
Scientific Institute&mdash;holds its meetings, and here, to a
crowded gathering under the presidency of Mr. Austen King, the
subject was gone into.&nbsp; It was delightful for the
Pickwickian stranger to meet so appreciative a response, and many
curious details were mentioned.&nbsp; At the close&mdash;such is
the force of the delusion&mdash;we were all discussing Mr.
Pickwick and his movements here and there, with the same
<i>conviction</i> as we would have had in the case of Miss
Burney, or Mrs. Thrale or Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; The whole atmosphere
was congenial, and there was an old-world, old-fashioned air over
the rooms.&nbsp; It was delightful to be talking of Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s Bath adventures in Bath.</p>
<p>Nor was there anything unreasonably fantastical in making such
speculations all but realities.&nbsp; Bantam lived, as we know,
in St. James&rsquo;s Square&mdash;that very effective enclosure,
with its solemn house and rich deep greenery, that recall our own
Fitzroy.&nbsp; No. 14 was his house, and this, it was
ascertained, was the actual residence of the living M.C.&nbsp;
How bold, therefore, of Boz to send up Sam to the very
Square!&nbsp; Everyone, too, knew Mrs. Craddock&rsquo;s house in
the Circus&mdash;at least it was one of two.&nbsp; It was No. 15
or 16, because at the time there were only a couple in the middle
which were let in lodgings, the rest being private houses.&nbsp;
This was fairly reasonable.&nbsp; But how accurate was Boz!&nbsp;
No doubt he had some friends who were quartered in lodgings
there.</p>
<p>I scarcely hoped to find the scene of the footmen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;swarry&rdquo; tracked out, but so it was.&nbsp; On leaving
Queen Square in company with Mr. Smauker to repair to the scene
of the festivity, Sam and his friend set off walking
&ldquo;towards High Street,&rdquo; then &ldquo;turned down a
bye-street,&rdquo; and would &ldquo;soon be there.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This bye-street was one <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>turning out of Queen Square at the
corner next Bantam&rsquo;s house; and a few doors down we find a
rather shabby-looking &ldquo;public&rdquo; with a swinging sign,
on which is inscribed &ldquo;The Beaufort Arms&rdquo;&mdash;a
two-storied, three-windowed house.&nbsp; This, in the book, is
called a &ldquo;greengrocer&rsquo;s shop,&rdquo; and is firmly
believed to be the scene of &ldquo;the Swarry&rdquo; on the
substantial ground that the Bath footmen used to assemble here
regularly as at their club.&nbsp; The change from a public to a
greengrocer&rsquo;s scarcely affects the point.&nbsp; The
uniforms of these gentlemen&rsquo;s gentlemen were really
splendid, as we learn from the text&mdash;rich plushes, velvets,
gold lace, canes, &amp;c.&nbsp; There is no exaggeration in this,
for natives of Bath have assured me they can recall similar
displays at the fashionable church&mdash;of Sundays&mdash;when
these noble creatures, arrayed gorgeously as
&ldquo;generals,&rdquo; were ranged in lines outside
&ldquo;waiting their missuses,&rdquo; <i>pace</i> Mr. John
Smauker.&nbsp; At the greengrocer&rsquo;s, where the Bath footmen
had their &ldquo;swarry,&rdquo; the favourite drink was
&ldquo;cold srub and water,&rdquo; or &ldquo;gin and water
sweet;&rdquo; also &ldquo;S&rsquo;rub punch,&rdquo; a West
Indian, drink, has now altogether disappeared.&nbsp; It sounds
strange to learn that a fashionable footman should consult
&ldquo;a copper timepiece which dwelt at the bottom of a deep
watch-pocket, and was raised to the surface by means of a black
string with a copper key.&rdquo;&nbsp; A <i>copper</i> watch
seems extraordinary, though we have now those of gun metal.</p>
<p>The Royal Crescent, with its fine air and fine view, always
strikes one with admiration as a unique and original monument:
the size and proportions are so truly grand.&nbsp; The whole
scene of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s escapade here is extraordinarily
vivid, and so protracted, while Mrs. Dowler was waiting in her
sedan for the door to be opened, that it has the effect of
imprinting the very air, look, and tone of the Royal Cresent on
us.&nbsp; We seem to be waiting with her and the chair-man.&nbsp;
It seems the most <i>natural</i> thing in the world.&nbsp; The
houses correspond almost exactly with Phiz&rsquo;s drawing.</p>
<p>Pickwick, it has been often pointed out, is full of amusing
&ldquo;oversights,&rdquo; which are pardonable enough, and almost
add to the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; of the piece.&nbsp; At the opening,
Mr. Pickwick is described as carrying his portmanteau&mdash;in
the picture it is a carpet-bag.&nbsp; The story opens in 1827,
but at once Mr. Jingle begins to talk of being <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>present at
the late Revolution of 1830.&nbsp; The &ldquo;George and
Vulture&rdquo; is placed in two different streets.&nbsp; Old
Weller is called Samuel.&nbsp; During the scene at the Royal
Crescent we are told that Mrs. Craddock threw up the drawing-room
window &ldquo;just as Mr. Winkle was rushing into the
chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; She ran and called Mr. Dowler, who rushed in
just as Mr. Pickwick threw up the other window, &ldquo;when the
first object that met the gaze of both was Mr. Winkle bolting
into the sedan chair&rdquo; into which he had bolted a minute
before.&nbsp; The late Charles Dickens the younger, in the notes
to his father&rsquo;s writings, affects to have discovered an
oversight in the account of the scene in the Circus.&nbsp; It is
described how he &ldquo;took to his heels and tore <i>round</i>
the Crescent, hotly pursued by Dowler and the coachman.&nbsp; He
kept ahead; the door was open as he came <i>round</i> the second
time, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, objects the son, the Cresent is
only a half circle; there is no going round it, you must turn
back when you come to the end.&nbsp; Boz must have been thinking
of the Circus.&nbsp; Hardly&mdash;for he knew both well&mdash;and
Circus and Crescent are things not to be confused.&nbsp; The
phrase was a little loose, but, as the Circus was curved
&ldquo;round,&rdquo; is not inappropriate, and he meant that
Winkle turned when he got to the end, and ran back.</p>
<p>It must have been an awkward thing for Winkle to present
himself once more at Mrs. Craddock&rsquo;s in the Crescent.&nbsp;
How was the incident to be explained save either at his own
expense or at that of Mr. Dowler?&nbsp; If Dowler were supposed
to have gone in pursuit of him, then Mr. Winkle must have fled,
and if he were supposed to have gone to seek a friend, then
Dowler was rather compromised.&nbsp; No doubt both gentlemen
agreed to support the one story that they had gone away for
mutual satisfaction, and had made it up.</p>
<p>Then, we are told, if it were theatre night perhaps the
visitors met at the theatre.&nbsp; Did Mr. Pickwick ever
go?&nbsp; This is an open question.&nbsp; Is the chronicler here
a little obscure, as he is speaking of &ldquo;the
gentlemen&rdquo; <i>en bloc</i>?&nbsp; Perhaps he did, perhaps he
did&rsquo;nt, as Boz might say.&nbsp; On his visit to Rochester,
it does not appear that he went to see his
&ldquo;picked-up&rdquo; friend, Jingle, perform.&nbsp; The Bath
Theatre is in the Saw Close, next door to Beau Nash&rsquo;s
picturesque old house.&nbsp; The old grey front, with its
blackened mouldings and <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>sunk windows, is still there; but a
deep vestibule, or entrance, with offices has been built out in
front, which, as it were, thrusts the old wall back&mdash;an
uncongenial mixture.&nbsp; Within, the house has been
reconstructed, as it is called, so that Mr. Palmer or Dimond, or
any of the old Bath lights, to say nothing of Mr. and Mrs.
Siddons, would not recognise it.&nbsp; Attending it one night, I
could not but recall the old Bath stories, when this modest
little house supplied the London houses regularly with the best
talent, and &ldquo;From the Theatre Royal, Bath,&rdquo; was an
inducement set forth on the bill.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Boz and Bath</h3>
<p>After his brilliant, genial view of the old watering-place, it
is a surprise to find Boz speaking of it with a certain acerbity
and even disgust.&nbsp; Over thirty years later, in 1869, he was
there, and wrote to Forster: &ldquo;The place looks to me like a
cemetery which the dead have succeeded in rising and
taking.&nbsp; Having built streets of their old gravestones, they
wander about scantly, trying to look alive&mdash;a dead
failure.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet, what ghostly recollections must
have come back on him as he walked those streets, or as he passed
by into Walcot, the Saracen&rsquo;s Head, where he had put up in
those old days, full of brightness, ardour, and enthusiasm; but
not yet the famous Boz!&nbsp; Bath folk set down this jaundiced
view of their town to a sort of pique at the comparative failure
of the Guild dramatic performance at the Old Assembly Rooms,
where, owing to the faulty arrangement of the stage, hardly a
word could be heard, to the dissatisfaction of the
audience.&nbsp; The stage, it seems, was put too far behind the
proscenium, &ldquo;owing to the headstrong perversity of Dickens,
who never forgave the Bath people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles Knight,
it was said, remonstrated, but in vain.&nbsp; Boz, however, was
not a man to indulge in such feelings.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Bleak
House&rdquo; he calls it &ldquo;dreary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been, however, a previous visit to Bath, in company
with Maclise and Forster, to see Landor, who was then living at
No. 35 St. James&rsquo;s Square&mdash;a house become memorable
because it was there that the image of his &ldquo;Little
Nell&rdquo; first suggested itself.&nbsp; The enthusiastic Landor
used, in his &ldquo;tumultuous&rdquo; fashion, to proclaim that
he would set fire to the house and burn it to the ground <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>to prevent its being profaned by less sacred
associations.&nbsp; He had done things even more extravagant than
this, and would take boisterous roars of laughter as his odd
compliment was discussed.</p>
<p>The minuteness of his record of the gaieties shows how amused
and interested Boz was in all that he saw.&nbsp; Nothing escaped
him of the routine, day, hour, and place; all is given, even the
different rooms at the Assembly House.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
ball-room, the long card-room, the octagon card-room, the
staircases, the passages, the hum of many voices and the sound of
many feet were perfectly bewildering; dresses rustled, feathers
waved, lights shone, and jewels sparkled.&nbsp; There was the
music, not of the quadrille band, for it had not yet
commenced,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Here Bantam, M.C., arrived at
precisely twenty minutes before eight, &ldquo;to receive the
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; And such company!&nbsp; &ldquo;Brilliant
eyes, lighted up with pleasurable expectation, gleamed from every
side, and, look where you would, some exquisite form glided
gracefully through the throng, and was no sooner lost than it was
replaced by another as dainty and bewitching&rdquo;; the warmth
of which description showing how delighted was the young man with
all he saw.&nbsp; But how did he secure admission?&nbsp; For it
was a highly fashionable company; there were vouchers and tickets
to be secured.&nbsp; But these were slight difficulties for our
brilliant &ldquo;pushful&rdquo; young man.&nbsp; He could make
his way, and his mission found him interest.&nbsp; He certainly
saw as much of Bath as anyone could in the time.&nbsp; Yet, gay
and sprightly as was his account of Bath, there may have been a
reason why Boz may have not recalled the place with pleasurable
feelings.&nbsp; It will be recollected that, after giving a few
lines to the account of Mr. Pickwick and friends being set down
at the White Hart, he carries them off at once to lodgings in the
Crescent.&nbsp; That first-class hotel was, alas! not open to the
poor, over-worked reporter; and he could tell of nothing that
went on within its portals.&nbsp; Hotel life on a handsome scale
was not for <i>him</i>, and he was obliged to put up at far
humbler quarters, a sort of common inn.</p>
<p>There is nothing more quaint or interesting than this genuine
antique&mdash;the Saracen&rsquo;s Head in Walcot.&nbsp; It may
pair off with the old White Horse in Canongate, where
&ldquo;Great Sam&rdquo; put up for a night.&nbsp; It is surely
the most effective of all the old inns one could <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>see.&nbsp; It has two faces, and looks into two
different streets, with its double gables, and date (1713)
inscribed on a tablet outside.&nbsp; It is a yellow, well-worn
little building.&nbsp; And you enter through darkened tunnels, as
it were, cut through the house, coming into a strange yard of
evident antiquity, with a steep, ladder-like flight of stone
steps that leads up to a window much like the old Canongate
houses.&nbsp; Here, then, it was that Boz put up, and here are
preserved traditions and relics of his stay.&nbsp; One of the
tales is that, after some exuberant night <i>in the election
time</i>, he would get his candle and, having to cross the court,
would have it blown out half a dozen times, when he would go back
patiently to relight it.&nbsp; They show his chair, and a jug out
of which he drank, but one has not much faith in these chairs and
jugs; they always seem to be supplied to demand, and must be
found to gratify the pilgrims.</p>
<p>One of the examination queries which might have found a place
in Mr. Calverley&rsquo;s paper of questions is this: &ldquo;When
did Mr. Pickwick sit down <i>to make entries in his journal</i>,
and spend half an hour in so doing?&rdquo;&nbsp; At Bath on the
night of Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s race round the Crescent.&nbsp; What
was this journal?&nbsp; Or why did he keep it?&nbsp; Or why are
so few allusions made to it?&nbsp; Mr. Snodgrass was the
appointed historiographer of the party, and his
&ldquo;notes&rdquo; are often spoken of and appealed to as the
basis of the chronicle.&nbsp; But half an hour, as I say, was the
time the great man seems to have allotted to his posting up the
day&rsquo;s register: &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick shut up the book, wiped
his pen <i>on the bottom of the inside of his coat-tail</i>, and
opened the drawer of the inkstand to put it carefully
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; How particular&mdash;how real all this
is!&nbsp; This it is that gives the <i>living</i> force to the
book, and a persuasion&mdash;irresistible almost&mdash;that it is
all about <i>some living person</i>.&nbsp; I have often wondered
how it is that this book of Boz&rsquo;s has such an astounding
power of development, such a fertility in engendering other
books, and what is the secret of it.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s
astonishing Waverley series, Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vanity
Fair,&rdquo; Boz&rsquo;s own &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; in fact, not one of the whole series
save &ldquo;the immortal &lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo;&rdquo; has
produced anything in the way of books or commentaries.&nbsp; I
believe it is really owing to this.&nbsp; Boz was a great admirer
of Boswell&rsquo;s equally immortal book.&nbsp; I have <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>heard
him speak of it.&nbsp; He attempted parodies of it even.&nbsp; He
knew all the turns, the Johnsonian twists, &ldquo;Why,
sirs,&rdquo; &amp;c., and used them in his letters.&nbsp; He was
permeated with the Johnsonian ether; that detail, that
description of trifling things which was in Boswell, attracted
him, and he felt it; and the fact remains that Pickwick is
written on <i>the principles</i>&mdash;no copy&mdash;of the great
biography, and that Boz applied to a mere fictional story what
was related in the account of a living man.&nbsp; And it is
really curious that Boswell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Johnson&rdquo;
should be the only other book that tempts people to the same rage
for commentary, illustrations, and speculations.&nbsp; These are
of exactly the same character in both books.</p>
<p>The MS. that Mr. Pickwick so oddly found in the drawer of his
inkstand at Mrs. Craddock&rsquo;s, Royal Crescent, Bath, offered
another instance of Boz&rsquo;s ingenious methods of introducing
episodical tales into his narrative.&nbsp; He was often hard put
to it to find an occasion: they were highly useful to fill a
space when he was pressed for matter.&nbsp; He had the strongest
<i>penchant</i> for this sort of thing, and it clung to him
through his life.&nbsp; Those in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; are
exceedingly good, full of spirit and &ldquo;go,&rdquo; save one,
the &ldquo;Martha Lobbs&rdquo; story, which is a poorish
thing.&nbsp; So good are the others, they have been taken out and
published separately.&nbsp; They were no doubt written for
magazines, and were lying by him, but his Bath
story&mdash;&ldquo;The True Legend of Prince
Bladud&rdquo;&mdash;was written specially.&nbsp; It is quite in
the vein of Elia&rsquo;s Roast Pig story, and very gaily
told.&nbsp; He had probably been reading some local guide-book,
with the mythical account of Prince Bladud, and this suggested to
him his own humorous version.&nbsp; At the close, he sets Mr.
Pickwick a-yawning several times, who, when he had arrived at the
end of this little manuscript&mdash;which certainly could not
have been compressed into &ldquo;a couple of sheets of
writing-paper,&rdquo; but would have covered at least ten
pages&mdash;replaced it in the drawer, and &ldquo;then, with a
<i>countenance of the utmost weariness</i>, lighted his chamber
candle and went upstairs to bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here, by the
way, is one of the amusing oversights which give such a piquancy
to &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before he began to read his
paper, we are carefully told that Mr. Pickwick &ldquo;unfolded
it, lighted his bedroom candle that it might burn up to the time
he had <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>finished.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Mr. C.
Kent who pointed this out to him, when Boz seized the volume and
humorously made as though he would hurl it at his friend.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in Bath must of necessity be interested in
Bristol, to which, as all know, Mr. Winkle fled after the unhappy
business in the Circus.&nbsp; He found a coach at the Royal
Hotel&mdash;which no longer exists&mdash;a vehicle which, we are
told, went the whole distance &ldquo;twice a day and more&rdquo;
with a single pair of horses.&nbsp; There he put up at the Bush,
where Mr. Pickwick was to follow him presently.&nbsp; The
Bush&mdash;a genuine Pickwick inn&mdash;where Mr. Pickwick first
heard the news of the action that was to be brought against him,
stood in Corn Street, near to the Guildhall, the most busy street
in Bristol; but it was taken down in 1864, and the present
Wiltshire Bank erected on the site.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick broke off
his stay at Bath somewhat too abruptly; he left it and all its
festivities on this sudden chase after Winkle.&nbsp; But he may
have had a reason.&nbsp; Nothing is more wonderful than
Boz&rsquo;s propriety in dealing with his incidents, a propriety
that is really instinctive.&nbsp; Everything falls out in the
correct, natural way.&nbsp; For instance, Mr. Pickwick having
received such a shock at the Bush&mdash;the announcement of the
Bardell action&mdash;was scarcely in heart to resume his jollity
and gaieties at Bath.&nbsp; We might naturally expect a
resumption of the frolics there.&nbsp; He accordingly returned
there; but we are told curtly, &ldquo;The remainder of the period
which Mr. Pickwick had assigned as the duration of his stay at
Bath passed over without an occurrence of anything
material.&nbsp; Trinity term commenced on the expiration of the
first week.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick and his friends returned to
London; and the former gentleman, attended of course by Sam,
straightway repaired to his old quarters at the George and
Vulture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now in these simple sentences have we not the secret of
the great attraction of the book?&nbsp; Who would not suppose
that this was a passage from a biography of some one that had
lived?&nbsp; How carefully <i>minute</i> and yet how naturally
the time is accounted for&mdash;&ldquo;passed over without the
occurrence of anything material.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is impossible to
resist this air of <i>vraisemblance</i>.</p>

39</span>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; OLD ROCHESTER</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;Jingle and the Theatre</h3>
<p>The little Theatre here must be interesting to us from the
fact of Jingle&rsquo;s having been engaged to play there with the
officers of the 52nd Regiment on the night of May 15th,
1827.&nbsp; Jingle was described as &ldquo;a strolling
actor,&rdquo; and belonged to the &ldquo;Kent circuit,&rdquo;
that is, to the towns of Canterbury, Rochester, Maidstone,
&amp;c.&nbsp; To this circuit also belonged &ldquo;Dismal
Jemmy,&rdquo; who was &ldquo;no actor,&rdquo; yet did the
&ldquo;heavy business.&rdquo;&nbsp; It does not appear that he,
also, was engaged for the officers&rsquo; performance.&nbsp; We
often wonder whether Jingle <i>did</i> perform on the night in
question; or did Dr. Payne and Lieutenant Tappleton tell the
story of his behaviour to their brethren: of his passing himself
off as a gentleman, his wearing another gentleman&rsquo;s
clothes, and his insults to Dr. Slammer.&nbsp; Tappleton
scornfully recommended Mr. Pickwick to be more nice in the
selection of his companions.&nbsp; No doubt Jingle was suggested
to the officers by the manager: &ldquo;knew a really smart chap
who will just do for the part.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the whole, I think
they must have had his services, as it was too late to get a
substitute.&nbsp; Jingle, as we know, was played successfully by
Sir Henry Irving in the early &rsquo;seventies, <i>tempore</i>
Bateman.&nbsp; His extraordinary likeness to the Phiz portrait
struck every one, and it was marked, not only in face, but in
figure, manner, &amp;c.&nbsp; The adaptation of
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; however, was very roughly done by the
late James Albery, who merely <i>tacked</i> together the Jingle
scenes.&nbsp; Those, where there is much genial comedy, such as
the Ball scene at Rochester, were left out.&nbsp; It is likely
that the boy, Boz, noticed Dismal Jemmy among the strollers, and
possibly may have seen a Jingle himself.&nbsp; But the characters
of Jingle and his confederate, Job, were certainly suggested by
Robert Macaire and Jacques Strop, which, a little before the
appearance of Pickwick, were being played in London&mdash;in
&ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;Auberge des Adrets</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Mr. Pickwick had discovered in the morning that Jingle
was &ldquo;connected with the Theatre in that place, <i>though he
is not desirous to have it generally known</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now considering generally the different &ldquo;games&rdquo; he
was pursuing, his passing himself off as an officer, an amateur
of cricket, &amp;c., it was not altogether desirable to have his
profession known.&nbsp; Knowing also that Mr. Pickwick intended
staying at Rochester, and that the gay Tupman or Snodgrass would
find out his engagement and witness his performance, he likely
enough confided his secret to Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dismal
Jemmy,&rdquo; the odd being who appears at Rochester for a short
time, had promised Mr. Pickwick a tale which he never gave
him.&nbsp; At the end of the story, <i>Boz</i>, having forgotten
the engagement, is driven to supply a far-fetched reason.&nbsp;
He was Job&rsquo;s brother, and went to America &ldquo;in
consequence of being too much sought after here.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
will be recollected he was of a depressed and gloomy cast, and on
the Bridge at Rochester talked of suicide.&nbsp; He also told the
dismal &ldquo;stroller&rsquo;s tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, it is
plain that Boz drew him as a genuine character, and his behaviour
to the stroller was of a charitable kind.&nbsp; Boz, in fact,
meant him to be a suitable person to relate so dismal an
incident.&nbsp; However, all this was forgotten or put aside at
the end, and having become Job&rsquo;s brother, he had to be in
keeping.&nbsp; The reformed Jingle declared he was &ldquo;merely
acting&mdash;clever rascal&mdash;hoaxing fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
brother Job added that he himself was the serious one,
&ldquo;while Jemmy never was.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick then
presumed that his talk of suicide was all flam, and that his
dismals were all assumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He could assume
anything,&rdquo; said Job.&nbsp; Boz, too, forgot that his name
was James Hutley, whereas the brothers&rsquo; was
Trotter&mdash;though this may have been an assumed one.</p>
<p>The condition of the Rochester stage must have been rather
low, when we find two such persons as Jingle and Dismal Jemmy
members of the corps.&nbsp; Jingle&rsquo;s jerky system of
elocution would seem a complete disqualification.&nbsp; From
sheer habit, it would have been impossible for him to say his
lines in any other fashion&mdash;which in all the round of light
&ldquo;touch and go&rdquo; comedy, would have been a
drawback.</p>
<p>The little Theatre is at the farther end of the town, where
the road turns off to the fields, a low, unpretending building
with a small <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>portico.&nbsp; I recall it in the old
days, on a walk from Gads Hill, when I paused to examine the
bills of the benefit of a certain theatrical family of the
Crummles sort&mdash;father, mother, sons, and daughters, who
supplied everything.&nbsp; The head founded his claims to support
on being a fellow townsman, winding up with Goldsmith&rsquo;s
lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>And as the hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,<br
/>
Pants to the spot from whence at first it flew;<br />
I still had hopes, my lengthened wanderings past,<br />
Here to return, and die at home at last.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boz was hugely amused when I rehearsed this to him at
lunch.</p>
<p>He himself, on his later visit, noted the strange
encroachments that were being made on the Theatre.&nbsp; A wine
merchant had begun on the cellars, and was gradually squeezing
himself into the box-office, and would no doubt go on till he
secured the auditorium, the lobbies, etc.&nbsp; When I last
passed by that way, it had become the Conservative Club, or some
such institution.</p>
<p>The wonderful picture, given in &ldquo;Nickleby,&rdquo; of the
Portsmouth playhouse, with all its characters and accessories and
inner life, shows the most intimate familiarity with all the ways
and fashions of the old Provincial Theatre.&nbsp; Every
touch&mdash;Crummles, Folair, Lenville, Snivelicci&mdash;proves
clearly that he knew perfectly the life behind the scenes, and
that he wrote of it <i>con amore</i>.&nbsp; There was a firm
belief at the Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, that all the performers
in &ldquo;Nickleby&rdquo; were personal sketches of this
corps.&nbsp; One actor told my friend, Mr. Walter Pollock, that
they could even identify Folair, Lenville &amp; Co., and that
there was a playbill still extant in which either the names or
the pieces corresponded.&nbsp; But in this theory, however,
little faith can be placed; for at the time the family was at
Portsmouth, Dickens was but a child not more than ten or twelve
years old, and not likely, therefore, to be taken behind the
scenes, or to pick up or observe much.&nbsp; It is certain that
the whole description of the Theatre and its company, with the
minute and intimate details of stage life, was drawn from this
little house at Rochester.&nbsp; But we can go beyond mere
speculation.</p>
<p>In one of his retrospections, Boz tells us of a visit he paid
to Rochester in the fifties, &ldquo;scenes among which my
<i>early days</i> were past.&rdquo;&nbsp; The town he calls
Dullborough, which is a little hard on the <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>place.&nbsp;
He went to look at the old theatre, and reveals to us how it
brought back to him a number of reminiscences, which shows that
he was much associated with stage matters when a youth, for he
describes Richard III. and Macbeth all &ldquo;cast&rdquo; and
mounted exactly as Mr. Crummles would have mounted them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was Richard in a very uncomfortable wig, and
sleeping in war time on a sofa that was much too short for him,
and his conscience fearfully troubled his boots.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was the lovely young woman, &ldquo;who went out gleaning,
in a narrow, white muslin apron, with five beautiful bars of five
different colours across it.&nbsp; The witches bore an awful
resemblance to the Thanes and other inhabitants of Scotland;
while the good King Duncan couldn&rsquo;t rest in his grave, but
was constantly coming out of it and calling himself somebody
else.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are all Crummles touches, only he
refrained from going again over the old ground.&nbsp; But one
point further favours the theory&mdash;he recalls his alarm when
Richard in his terrific combat was &ldquo;backing up against the
stage box.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was in the stage box then, and
therefore a privileged person at the theatre.&nbsp; His uncle,
&ldquo;Dr. Slammer,&rdquo; no doubt was thus complimented as
being &ldquo;in Her Majesty&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;the town had shrunk
fearfully since I was a child there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The description of the outlaw drama which Nicholas Nickleby
saw on the night of his arrival is exactly in the key of the
account of the performance of &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; just
given: also the account of the London manager, who was in the
boxes; still more so when Mr. Crummles and all the company
<i>died at him</i>.&nbsp; And as in Nickleby we have &ldquo;the
Comic Countryman&rdquo; who so inopportunely caught a bluebottle
when Mrs. Crummles was making her great point for the London
Manager: so in the account of Dullborough we are told of
&ldquo;the <i>Funny</i> Countryman&rdquo; who sustained the
comic, bucolic parts.&nbsp; This alone would show that the
Rochester and Portsmouth Theatres were the same, while the
beautiful young lady in the white apron performed the same sort
of characters that Miss Bravassa, or Miss Snivelicci did.</p>
<p>And in this connection may be supplied a further speculation
which is interesting.&nbsp; In <i>Boz&rsquo;s</i> earlier works
it is plain that he relies for his most striking effects of
character on his own recollections and <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>personal
observations.&nbsp; They might be considered passages from his
autobiography.&nbsp; I have thought that much in
&ldquo;Nickleby&rdquo; of Nicholas&rsquo;s career and
Nicholas&rsquo;s own character was drawn from himself.&nbsp;
Nicholas suggests Boz in appearance, in his spirit and vehemence,
and in some of his adventures.&nbsp; Some years ago a remarkable
letter appeared in the papers, in which Dickens, then a mere
youth, made an application to one of the managers, Mr. Webster I
think, for a situation in his theatre.&nbsp; He wanted to go on
the stage.&nbsp; Was not this like Nicholas?&nbsp; This desire
was surely founded on intimate acquaintance with the boards and
amateur experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had entertained the impression,&rdquo; he goes on,
&ldquo;that the High Street was as wide as Regent Street&mdash;I
found it little better than a lane.&nbsp; There was a public
clock in it which I had supposed to be the finest clock in the
world, whereas it now turned out to be <i>as inexpressive</i>,
<i>moon-faced and weak</i> a clock as ever I saw.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Town Hall was a &ldquo;mean little brick heap, like a
demented chapel.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;The Bull</h3>
<p>Jingle, it will be recollected, on the party arriving at the
Bull, gave that Inn the highest praise, recommending them to stay
there&mdash;&ldquo;<i>good house</i>&mdash;<i>nice
beds</i>&mdash;&rdquo; a testimonial that used to be displayed in
gold letters at the door, but which, I have seen it stated, has
been removed.&nbsp; I have also read the same testimonial in the
guides and advertisements.&nbsp; Jingle warned them against
another Inn hard by,&mdash;&ldquo;Wright&rsquo;s&mdash;next
house&mdash;<i>dear</i>&mdash;<i>very dear</i>&mdash;half-a-crown
if you look at the waiter, making a charge for dinner, all the
same, if you dined out&rdquo;; a practice, however, not
altogether unknown to modern Hotels.&nbsp; It was bold in Boz,
thus to publicly disparage Hotels that he did not approve.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wright&rsquo;s&rdquo; could not have relished so public an
allusion.&nbsp; What or where was
Wright&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;next house?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
now&mdash;in the same High Street&mdash;&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; described as &ldquo;Family and Commercial, one of
the oldest-established in the Kingdom, close to the Cathedral and
Castle&mdash;home comforts.&rdquo;&nbsp; This being its
position&mdash;the Castle on one side, the Cathedral on the
other&mdash;situated exactly as the Bull was&mdash;and therefore
&ldquo;next house,&rdquo; accurately described its
position.&nbsp; Being &ldquo;one of the
oldest-established,&rdquo; it must have been there at the time of
the Pickwickian visit.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>At the Bull, they show you &ldquo;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
room&rdquo;&mdash;as well as Tupman&rsquo;s and
Winkle&rsquo;s&mdash;Boz&rsquo;s very particular description
enables this to be done.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s was, of
course, to the front&mdash;when, roused by the Boots, he gave the
direction of his followers&rsquo; bed-room, &ldquo;next room but
two on the right hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Winkle&rsquo;s room was
inside Tupman&rsquo;s&mdash;so we are shown a room in the front
with another inside of it&mdash;and the <i>third</i> on the left
will, of course, be Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, Q.E.D.&nbsp; The
waiters know all these points, and prove them to the bewildered
visitors.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, sir, there is the very room
<i>where the clothes were stolen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Jingle&rsquo;s Love Affairs</h3>
<p>Jingle&rsquo;s elopement with the spinster aunt was
ingeniously contrived, but it seemed rather speculative and
rash&mdash;she might not have had a penny.&nbsp; His only ground
for jumping to the conclusion that she <i>had</i> a fortune was
that, on his saying that &ldquo;Tupman only wants your
money&rdquo;; &ldquo;The wretch!&rdquo; she
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s doubts were
resolved&mdash;she <i>had</i> money.&rdquo;&nbsp; More wonderful,
too, were the very easy terms on which he was &ldquo;bought
off&rdquo;&mdash;a hundred and twenty pounds.&nbsp; Her fortune
might be estimated at some thousands.&nbsp; He was really master
of the situation.&nbsp; The lady was of mature age&mdash;her own
mistress, Wardle and his attorney could do nothing to stop the
business.&nbsp; He certainly might have held out for four or five
hundred pounds.&nbsp; Perker&rsquo;s diplomacy was wretched, and
his plea about the age of the old lady mere burlesque.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are right, my dear sir&mdash;she is rather old.&nbsp;
The founder of the family came into Kent when Julius C&aelig;sar
invaded Britain; only one member of it since who hasn&rsquo;t
lived to eighty-five, and <i>he</i> was beheaded by one of the
Henrys.&nbsp; The old lady is not seventy-three now, my dear
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which seems like buffooning in a man of
business.</p>
<p>Jingle&rsquo;s course, after he left Rochester, can be traced
very readily.&nbsp; With plenty of money in his pocket, he found
his way to Ipswich (or Eatanswill), assuming the name of Captain
FitzMarshall, and taking with him, as his confederate, Job
Hutley.&nbsp; There he got introduced to Nupkins, the Mayor, who
presided at the election, and who had made his money in
&ldquo;the nail and sarsepan business&rdquo;&mdash;that is, as an
ironmonger.&nbsp; The few words this functionary uttered on the
hustings are of the same pompous character as his later
magisterial deliverances.</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whiffin, <i>proclaim</i> silence,&rsquo;
said the Mayor, with air of <i>pomp</i>, &amp;c., where this
superciliousness is emphasised.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; he
went on, &lsquo;brother electors of the Borough of Eatanswill, we
are met here to-day for the purpose of choosing a representative
in the room of our late&rsquo;&mdash;but the noise and
interruptions prevented the rest of the speech being heard.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding, he characteristically &lsquo;thanked the meeting
for the patient attention with which they had heard him
throughout,&rsquo; a declaration that excited roars of laughter,
lasting for a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is exactly what one might expect from the self-sufficient
Nupkins, who was evidently understood and laughed at by his
fellow townsmen.&nbsp; Later, when the confusion and
&ldquo;row&rdquo; grew fast and furious, our Mayor &ldquo;issued
imperative orders to twelve constables to seize the ringleaders,
who might amount in number to two hundred and fifty or
thereabouts.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can recall Nupkins&rsquo; dealing
with the schoolboys in exactly the same sapient spirit.</p>
<p>Into the family of this worthy Jingle insinuated
himself.&nbsp; But would he not be recognised by Mr. Pickwick and
his friends?&nbsp; Yes; but we find that he took up his quarters
at Bury St. Edmunds, conveniently near, and, assuming that the
Pickwickians had departed after the election, thought he might
safely exhibit himself at Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s party, whence
he was tracked back to Bury by Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; It is
certainly fresh evidence of the identity of Eatanswill with
Ipswich that Jingle should have appeared in both places as
&ldquo;Captain FitzMarshall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once established in the
Mayor&rsquo;s family, the insinuating Jingle devoted himself to
the capture of the haughty and ill-natured Henrietta Nupkins,
making his way into her good graces, and &ldquo;cutting
out&rdquo; Sidney Porkenham, her old-established admirer.&nbsp;
This was Jingle&rsquo;s second attempt at matrimony which failed
like the first.&nbsp; It may be said, after all, that his
behaviour was not so heinous.&nbsp; He was a fortune hunting
adventurer&mdash;such was his role&mdash;which was common enough
in those times.&nbsp; The unlucky Leo Hunter meeting, however,
spoiled all.</p>
<p>After the trick on Mr. Pickwick at the school, and which was a
fair retort, the pair left Bury that very night.</p>
<p>By an odd coincidence, they were taken up the next day by <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>old Weller at Chelmsford&mdash;a stage or two from
London.&nbsp; He was driving the Ipswich coach, and brought them
to that town.&nbsp; It is clear, therefore, that they took this
round from Bury in dread of pursuit, and with a view to throw Mr.
Pickwick off the scent.&nbsp; The latter gentleman never dreamed
that they were so near him, dismissed the whole matter, and
returned to town to arrange about his action.&nbsp; By a happy
chance he met old Weller, and, within a few days, set off for
Ipswich and unmasked Captain FitzMarshall in Nupkins&rsquo; own
house.&nbsp; After this failure, his course was downward, and we
next meet him in the Fleet.</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s story was that Jingle dragged him away in a
post-chaise and persuaded the girl at the boarding-school to tell
Mr. Pickwick that she knew nothing of the matter.&nbsp; He had
also bribed the schoolmistress to tell the same story.&nbsp; He
had then deserted her for a better speculation, to wit, Miss
Nupkins, to whom he had hurried back.</p>
<p>But for Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s unfortunate adventure at the
&ldquo;White Horse,&rdquo; Jingle would likely enough have
captured Henrietta Nupkins.&nbsp; When Sam so opportunely met Job
in the Inn yard at Ipswich, he, instead of punishing him as he
had so often threatened to do, merely bid him be at the Inn at
eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Why did he not bring him straight to
Mr. Pickwick who was upstairs?&nbsp; Instead, he went up himself,
told his master it was &ldquo;all in trainin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;detailed the plan of action.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick was
curious, but Sam only said &ldquo;all in good time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We never learn what the plan of action was to be.&nbsp; Indeed,
what could the pair do to Jingle?</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;The Garrison</h3>
<p>The military recollections of Rochester and Chatham are
amusingly confused, or rather, in defiance of all known
regulations.&nbsp; Thus, at the Ball, we find Colonel Bulder as
&ldquo;head of the garrison&rdquo;&mdash;one would think at so
important a quarter, where there was a large garrison, a General
at least would be in command.&nbsp; Then we may ask the question,
why was not Dr. Slammer in uniform&mdash;always required in
presence of a commander?&nbsp; It was wonderfully bold, too, on
Boz&rsquo;s part to give the <i>numbers</i> of the
regiments.&nbsp; Hon. Wilmot Snipe of the 97th, who <i>was</i> in
full uniform, which Mr. Tupman took for &ldquo;a fancy <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>dress.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, of course, a Highland
one.&nbsp; We learn, too, that the other regiment was the 43rd,
to which Dr. Payne belonged, and that the 52nd was getting up
plays at the local theatre.&nbsp; And why did Boz select these
particular numbers?</p>
<p>The Chatham garrison consisted of &ldquo;half-a-dozen
regiments,&rdquo; with which a fair display at a Review could be
made on &ldquo;The Lines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Temporary fortifications
had been erected, the citadel was to be attacked and
taken&mdash;Fort Pitt we may assume&mdash;and a mine was to be
sprung.&nbsp; Servants were keeping places for the ladies
&ldquo;on the Batteries&rdquo;&mdash;an alarming position it
would seem.&nbsp; The Sergeants were running &ldquo;with vellum
books&rdquo; under their arms, usually left at home on
Review-day.&nbsp; The Officers were &ldquo;running backwards and
forwards,&rdquo; while Colonel Bulder was seen
&ldquo;gallopping&rdquo; (with two p&rsquo;s) at large,
&ldquo;prancing and curvetting,&rdquo; that is, making his steed
curvet.&nbsp; The operations were, however, not under his
command, but directed by the &ldquo;Commander-in-Chief,&rdquo;
not, of course, of the Army, but, we may presume, the General of
the district.&nbsp; His behaviour was the most extraordinary of
all, for, instead of cultivating a solemn reserve and quietude,
and standing still, surrounded by his staff, he was seen
&ldquo;backing his horse <i>among the people</i>,&rdquo; and
heard shouting &ldquo;till he was hoarse.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
soldiers wore the old, stiff leather stock, choking them, which
was heard of so much in Crimean days.&nbsp; They were also
arrayed in <i>white</i> trowsers.&nbsp; Boz is here wonderfully
accurate, for these garments were always worn after May came
round, and this was May.</p>
<p>The catastrophe to the Pickwickians from their having got
between the two lines of soldiers, is somewhat perplexing.&nbsp;
One line was advancing to the attack, the other firmly awaiting
it.&nbsp; They were shouted at to get out of the way.&nbsp;
Suddenly the half-dozen regiments had overthrown them.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick was upset.&nbsp; Winkle received a bloody nose, after
performing a compulsory <i>somerset</i>; then, at the same
moment&mdash;wonder of wonders&mdash;we were told that the
regiments were &ldquo;half-a-thousand yards
off,&rdquo;&mdash;that is about a third of a mile away&mdash;all
in a second!&nbsp; It is hard to understand why they were so
maltreated.&nbsp; The soldiers would, of course, never have met;
and in our own time the amenities of a Review and the police
would have secured stray civilians from such rough
treatment.&nbsp; We do not <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>know whether
the evolutions described were accurate&mdash;such as &ldquo;one
rank firing over the heads of another and then running
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to this exciting spectacle that old Wardle brought a
party in that wonderful Barouche of his&mdash;which is really
phenomenal for its accommodation.&nbsp; When Mr. Pickwick
recovered his hat, he found these persons in the
carriage:&mdash;1, Wardle; 2, a daughter; 3, a second ditto; 4, a
sister; 5, Trundle; 6, Tupman; 7, Fat Boy, on the box.&nbsp; The
Pickwickians were actually summoned by the hearty Wardle to
join.&nbsp; &ldquo;Room <i>for you all</i>&mdash;two inside and
one on the ox,&rdquo; where there was one already.&nbsp; All
accepted the invitation, making <i>ten</i> persons in all who
were accommodated in the Barouche!&nbsp; But this does not
exhaust its wonders.&nbsp; When lunch time came round, with
plates, dishes, bottles, eight persons were squeezed together
inside, so no wonder Wardle said, &ldquo;We must sit
close.&rdquo;&nbsp; How it was done is not to be
conceived&mdash;two sitting together is the usual allowance for a
modern Barouche, but four on one side!&mdash;and yet we are told,
when the horses were put to, the Barouche &ldquo;rattled
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy Dickens had carefully noted the behaviour of the
garrison, and described them as &ldquo;staggering about the
streets of Chatham dead drunk,&rdquo; more especially when we
remember that the &ldquo;following them about, and joking with
them, affords <i>a cheap and innocent amusement for the boy
population</i>&mdash;&rdquo; (<i>vide Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
notes</i>).&nbsp; The boy, no doubt, often witnessed the incident
of the private, &ldquo;drawing his bayonet, and stabbing the
barmaid who had refused to draw him more liquor.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is characteristic, by the way, of the police in a garrison town,
for this fellow appears to have been at large on the next day, as
he went down to the Tavern and tried to &ldquo;square it&rdquo;
with the girl.</p>
<p>And now, is not this a testimony to this strange book, that we
should be thus introduced to old Rochester and its doings, and
out of the scant materials furnished, can really reconstruct the
time and the place, and find out, as if by enquiries, all about
Jingle and his connections and the theatre&mdash;such is the
fruitfulness of the text?</p>
<h2><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; BOZ AND BLACKING.</h2>
<p>One of the remarkable things associated with
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; is its autobiographical character, as it
might be termed, and the amount of the author&rsquo;s personal
experience which is found in passages.&nbsp; Such are his
sketches of Rochester and Chatham life during his boyhood, his
recollections of Grimaldi&rsquo;s dissolute son, his own poignant
sorrow on the death of Mary Hogarth, and the painful memories of
his boyish apprenticeship to an uncongenial trade more than
hinted at.&nbsp; The election matters were also particular
memories of his own, so was the scene of the ghostly mail
coaches.&nbsp; Then there was the hideous recollection of the
life in a debtors&rsquo; prison, of which he had such sad
personal experience, with much more.&nbsp; He recalled the time
when he had a miserable lodging in Lant Street, Borough, and Lant
Street was for him always a fixed point in his memory, and grew
in size and importance.&nbsp; And when he described some wretched
creature hiding himself in London purlieus, he chose some
miserable place like College-street in Camden Town, whither his
own family had retired.</p>
<p>All these things supply a singular vitality and realism, and
also a distinct interest for those who are &ldquo;in the
know,&rdquo; for Boz himself at the time was a dramatic and
interesting figure, and this story of his struggle out of a state
of squalid misery is truly pathetic.</p>
<p>Readers of Forster&rsquo;s interesting &ldquo;Life&rdquo; will
recall the dismal passage in the account given by Dickens to his
friend, and his agonising experience when he was employed at the
blacking factory.&nbsp; Many at the time thought that this
painful episode might have been spared the reader, but the
uncompromising biographer would not sacrifice it.&nbsp; On the
whole, he was right, as the trial had an important influence on
the writer&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; It will be recollected that
he was employed at a place set up in Chandos Street, just out of
the Strand, <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>by one of the firm of Warrens, and
his duties seemed to consist in pasting the labels on the
bottles.&nbsp; Many will still recall the keen rivalry that
existed between the famous firms, Warren and Day and Martin,
which brought much amusement to the public from the arts of
&ldquo;bold advertisement&rdquo; with which the war was
waged.&nbsp; There were ingenious &ldquo;Crambos,&rdquo; such as
a cat gazing with well-assumed surprise at her face reflected in
one of Day and Martin&rsquo;s well-polished shoes.&nbsp; These
things made a deep impression on the boy, who saw their grotesque
side.&nbsp; They were oddly bound up with his early impressions
and sorrows.</p>
<p>Hence, we find in the course of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; a few
allusions to these blacking rivals and their ways, which might
seem mysterious and uncalled for to those not in the secret, but
which for himself had the highest significance.&nbsp; When Sam is
first introduced at the &ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; he is in the
very act of cleaning boots, and we have almost an essay on the
various species of boots and polishing.&nbsp; We are told
minutely that he was engaged in &ldquo;brushing the dirt off a
pair of boots . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; There were two rows before him,
one cleaned, the other dirty.&nbsp; &ldquo;There were
<i>eleven</i> pair, and one shoe, as belongs to No. 6 with the
wooden leg.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The eleven boots is to be called
at half-past eight (an odd consensus in eleven persons), and the
shoe at nine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He set to work upon a top-boot.</p>
<p>The landlady then made her appearance in the opposite gallery
and flung down a pair of shoes to be cleaned for No. 5, first
floor.&nbsp; There is a dramatic action in these calls from the
different galleries, which shows that Boz had the stage before
him.&nbsp; Sam then chalked the number on the sole.&nbsp; When he
found that it was for people of consequence in a private room
that the articles were required, he set to work with a will and
produced a polish &ldquo;that would have struck envy to the soul
of <i>the amiable Mr. Warren</i>, <i>for they used Day and
Martin&rsquo;s at the</i> &lsquo;<i>White
Hart</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here will be noted the compliment
to his old employer, though it was of a conventional sort.</p>
<p>With this very number &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was destined to
leap into its amazing popularity, and the advertisement must have
been a valuable one.&nbsp; There may have been another reason,
for there was to be a &ldquo;Pickwick advertiser,&rdquo; which
was patronised by the firms, and it may <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>have been
stipulated as a condition that the author was to give them this
&ldquo;lift.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another patron was Rowland, whose real
name was Rouland, of &ldquo;Maccassar oil&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Kalydor&rdquo; celebrity.&nbsp; We have a relic of one of
these forgotten nostrums in the familiar
&ldquo;Anti-maccassar&rdquo; known to every good housewife.&nbsp;
To Rowland or Rouland he later made an allusion in the text.</p>
<p>This method of calling attention to the merits of wares was a
French one&mdash;a sort of <i>r&eacute;clame</i> introduced by
Villemessant in his journal <i>La Sylphide</i>.&nbsp; Thus
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was quite &ldquo;up-to-date.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After Jingle had gone off to Doctors Commons for his license, Sam
renewed his efforts, &ldquo;burnishing a pair of <i>painted
tops</i>, worn by a farmer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, interrogated by
Perker, he described the tenants of the inn by their
boots&mdash;a pair of &ldquo;Hessians&rdquo; in 13, two pair of
&ldquo;halves,&rdquo; with six &ldquo;tops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In chapter xxxiv. we have another allusion to blacking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No man,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;ever talked in poetry
&rsquo;cept a beadle on Boxin&rsquo; Day, <i>or Warren&rsquo;s
blackin&rsquo;</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This referred to the
rhymes&mdash;or verses&mdash;with which the firm filled the
newspapers in praise of their article.&nbsp; It will be
remembered that Mrs. Jarley, in the &ldquo;Old Curiosity
Shop,&rdquo; employed &ldquo;a poet&rdquo; to celebrate her
waxworks in similar fashion, and who was content with a few
shillings for each effort.&nbsp; We may be certain that this was
a boyish recollection, and that he had seen this blacking
&ldquo;poet&rdquo; making his calls in Chandos Street or haggling
for his miserable wage.&nbsp; The beadle, also alluded to, was a
prominent figure with Boz; but he has disappeared, with his huge
cocked hat, scarlet waistcoat, and uniform.&nbsp; He is to be
seen in Wilkie&rsquo;s brilliant picture in the National
Gallery.&nbsp; It is evident from the passage that he came round
on Boxing Day for his <i>douceur</i>, reminding his patrons, as
the dustmen now do sometimes, by a copy of verses.&nbsp; Sam adds
that no one did this sort of thing except the persons
mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;and <i>Rowland&rsquo;s oil</i>, or some of
them low fellows.&rdquo;&nbsp; The perfumer could only have been
half pleased with this uncomplimentary form.&nbsp; Still, such as
it was, it <i>was</i> an advertisement.&nbsp; Boz also makes
several allusions to the inventor, Bramah, mentioning Bramah
locks and keys with plugs, &amp;c.&nbsp; Old Weller talks of
being locked up &ldquo;in a fireproof chest with a patent
<i>Bramin</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bramah&rsquo;s hydraulic press was a
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>scientific novelty then, as were also his &ldquo;patent
safes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bramah appears to have advertised in
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; These <i>r&eacute;clames</i> are of
a rather elaborate kind, as when Lowten arrived at the office
(lii), we are told, he drew &ldquo;a Bramah key from his pocket,
with a small plug therein to keep the dust out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
&ldquo;comforting himself with this reflection, Mr. Lowten
extricated the plug from the door key; having opened the door,
re-plugged and re-pocketed his Bramah.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The horrors of the
Blacking episode were ever present to Dickens&rsquo;
recollection, and, as if under a sort of fascination, he later
seemed almost impelled to refer to them.&nbsp; Thus, in
Copperfield, we find him describing, but under a disguise, the
same incident.&nbsp; As when he was sent to Murdstone and
Grimby&rsquo;s warehouse, it was still the washing and labelling
of bottles&mdash;&ldquo;<i>not of blacking</i>,&rdquo; but of
wines and spirits.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the empty bottles ran short,
there were labels to be pasted on the full ones, or corks to be
fitted to them, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is also another
allusion to the same, but curiously veiled, when he speaks of the
carman, Tipp, who &ldquo;wore a red jacket.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, to
this day Day and Martin&rsquo;s carmen wear red jackets, and
Warren&rsquo;s men probably did so; but, at all events, it is
clearly an allusion to the costume of the blacking drivers.&nbsp;
There are allusions to blacking in Little Dorrit and Bleak
House.</p>
<h2><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; SINGLE SPEECH TRUNDLE</h2>
<p>This gentleman, as we know, was the affianced husband of
Isabella Wardle, and to the scenes of their marriage, the
festivities, &amp;c., we owe some pleasing incidents.&nbsp;
Trundle was a good specimen of the <i>cypher</i> or nullity;
naturally, he is a figure at Manor Farm, but does nothing, and
practically says nothing.&nbsp; He was clearly a neighbouring
squire of limited ideas, or plain country gentlemen, that could
do no more than love his Isabella.&nbsp; Yet, while Boz describes
the &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; of Arabella and Winkle, of Emily and
Snodgrass, he wholly passes by Trundle and his
<i>inamorata</i>.&nbsp; We can see what manner of man Trundle
was, as he is shown seated in the barouche, at the review,
between the two sisters, each with long ringlets and
parasols.&nbsp; He is a good-looking young man, with mutton-chop
whiskers and black hair, on which his hat is set jauntily.&nbsp;
He is described as &ldquo;a young gentleman apparently enamoured
of one of the young ladies in scarfs and pattens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Wardle introduced him in a rather patronising way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is my friend, Mr. Trundle.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the
firing began, there was much agitation among the young ladies,
screaming, &amp;c., so that the gentlemen had to support them:
Mr. Trundle &ldquo;was actually obliged to hold one of them
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after the lunch was unpacked, the wine
uncorked, &amp;c., there came a remarkable
development&mdash;Trundle actually spoke, made the one single
remark that is recorded of him in the whole chronicle!&nbsp;
Never before or after did he say a word.&nbsp; He was, in fact,
&ldquo;single speech Trundle.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what were these
words: &ldquo;Will you permit me to have the pleasure,
Sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Trundle to Mr. Winkle; a proposal to
&ldquo;take wine with him,&rdquo; as it is called, Winkle had a
bottle all to himself on the box seat, which, no doubt, attracted
the reticent Trundle.&nbsp; The two gentlemen not only took wine
together, but had &ldquo;a glass round, ladies and
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we should note that Trundle phrase, the
almost too humble form: &ldquo;Will you permit me the pleasure,
Sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; It looks as though Trundle were &ldquo;an
ass,&rdquo; as it is called.&nbsp; The fact remains, however,
that Trundle&rsquo;s single speech was: &ldquo;Will you permit me
to have the pleasure, Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>After a few days&rsquo; interval, when Mr. Pickwick and
party found their way to Manor Farm, there were games
<i>galore</i>, and at the &ldquo;round one,&rdquo; Isabella and
Trundle, we are told, &ldquo;went partners,&rdquo; so all was
going on well.&nbsp; The Squire had been nearly brought up to the
point.&nbsp; It is painful to come to the conclusion, but
Isabella&rsquo;s admirer, though a country gentlemen, was nothing
of a sportsman, and rather a poor creature.&nbsp; When Mr.
Pickwick and his followers were up early and out at the rook
shooting, we find no Trundle.&nbsp; He was lying a-bed, no
doubt.&nbsp; Stranger still, when the whole party went in for a
day to Muggleton for the cricket match, Trundle was the only one
who stayed behind.&nbsp; He remained with the ladies, for a
purpose, no doubt; still, ladies don&rsquo;t like this sort of
thing.&nbsp; The evening came.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isabella and Emily
strolled out with Mr. Trundle.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have an idea that
on this very day matters came to a crisis in that quarter.&nbsp;
Everything favoured&mdash;all the men were away&mdash;he may have
seized the opportunity to &ldquo;propose.&rdquo;&nbsp; At all
events, we are significantly told that at the supper
&ldquo;Isabella Wardle devoted herself <i>exclusively</i> to Mr.
Trundle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pointed enough, surely.&nbsp; We may be
fortified in this view by finding that on the return of the
party, all dead drunk, at one in the morning, on Trundle was
specially cast the degrading menial duty of carrying Wardle to
bed&mdash;his future father-in-law.</p>
<p>Did Boz dislike this man all this while, or did he feel that
he could do nothing with him in the story?&nbsp; It is certain,
however, that in the talks at Bury over the Bardell action, the
Boarding School adventure, &amp;c., we never hear the sound of
Trundle&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; He is effaced.&nbsp; He makes no
remark on anything.</p>
<p>One of Boz&rsquo;s most daring pantomime changes, is the
sudden arrival of old Wardle at Bury, when Mr. Pickwick was
released from the cupboard&mdash;and sandwich bags&mdash;in Miss
Tomkins&rsquo; school.&nbsp; The door was unlocked, and there
stood Wardle and the silent Trundle.&nbsp; A rather lame account
is given of the coincidence.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick naturally asked,
&ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Trundle and I
came down here for some good shooting on the first,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; Now, here it is evident Wardle good-naturedly
saddled himself with the company of the silent man, but he had
his reasons.&nbsp; Trundle was now son-in-law <i>elect</i>.&nbsp;
They were both at the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; at Bury, and for some
days <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>here were Mr. Pickwick and his
&ldquo;followers.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the exciting notice of
action <i>re</i> Bardell v. Pickwick.&nbsp; There had nearly been
Pott v. Pott and Winkle.&nbsp; And yet, all the time, this
Trundle listens, and eats and drinks; but there is no sign of him
on the record.&nbsp; He is busy maintaining his character as a
cypher.</p>
<p>Everything, however, points to show the all but comtemptuous
opinion that was held of this Trundle.&nbsp; Wardle had been
there two or three days when Winkle and the others came over from
Eatanswill, yet he had never told Mr. Pickwick or Winkle that
Trundle was to be married at Christmas, and that they were all to
be invited to the wedding.&nbsp; By the oddest of coincidences,
Tupman and Snodgrass, getting down from the coach at the
&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; were met by Wardle, who at once said,
&ldquo;I have <i>just been</i> telling Pickwick that we must have
you all down at Christmas.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to have a
wedding.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I doubt if this <i>be</i> an
oversight.&nbsp; The fact was, no one thought anything of that
cypher Trundle, or of his marriage&mdash;a matter of no
importance to anybody.&nbsp; That this is the true explanation is
plain, for Snodgrass, fancying that the wedding was of <i>his</i>
lady, turned pale.&nbsp; What was old Wardle&rsquo;s
remark?&nbsp; Most significant of Trundle&rsquo;s
<i>status</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;<i>it&rsquo;s only</i> Trundle <i>there</i> and
Bella.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Only Trundle there,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, only that poor insignificant thing there!&nbsp; No
more depreciatory words could be chosen, or put into the mouth of
an honest country gentleman.&nbsp; I am certain that old Wardle
gave his child reluctantly to this soft sort of
fellow&mdash;&ldquo;Only Trundle there!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then for the
shooting party.&nbsp; We hear of Tupman and Winkle even, with
their guns, &amp;c., but not a sign of this Trundle, a country
gentleman, supposed to enjoy field sports.&nbsp; If Tupman and
Winkle had to carry their guns reversed &ldquo;like privates at a
funeral,&rdquo; was Trundle excepted?&nbsp; We cannot tell, for
he is not even named.&nbsp; Or was he of the shooting party at
all?&nbsp; It has always seemed astonishing that Winkle should
have been allowed, particularly by Mr. Pickwick, to join the
<i>second</i> shooting party.&nbsp; Everyone seemed to have
forgotten his first performance, when he might have shot his
friend Tupman dead, and, as it was, &ldquo;peppered&rdquo; him
severely.&nbsp; Tupman would naturally have objected to so
dangerous a companion.&nbsp; Wardle, at whose home the casualty
occurred, merely said, &ldquo;I beg <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>my friend
Winkle&rsquo;s pardon, though; he has had some
practice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was this ironical?&nbsp; I fancy the whole
scene had passed out of the author&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Well, the Christmas season having come round&mdash;and
certainly Trundle must have been a very feeble creature to allow
himself to be &ldquo;kept over&rdquo; for so long a
time&mdash;the whole party assembled at Manor Farm; now there,
and on such an occasion at least, Trundle, being one of the two
central figures, will certainly assert himself.&nbsp; We shall
expect to see and hear him to good effect.&nbsp; Never was there
a greater mistake.&nbsp; As the Pickwickians arrived, the whole
&ldquo;house party&rdquo; were in the lane to greet them; we are
told in careless fashion that among them &ldquo;there were
Isabella and <i>her faithful</i> Trundle,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the
poor insignificant &ldquo;chap&rdquo; who was about to enter the
family by particular favour.&nbsp; Then Mr. Pickwick was told
that they had all been to &ldquo;inspect the furniture and
fittings-up of the new house which the young couple were to
tenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is very significant, for it throws a
certain light on Trundle&rsquo;s situation.&nbsp; It is plain
that this house was on Wardle&rsquo;s property, and that Trundle
had none of his own.&nbsp; It was, in fact, a poorish match and
the young couple were dependent more or less on Wardle.&nbsp;
Even the old lady didn&rsquo;t like it, she resented their going
to look at the house, and her son, to soothe her, made this
significant speech: &ldquo;Recollect Bella; <i>come</i>, <i>you
must keep her spirits up</i>, <i>poor girl</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep her spirits
up!&rdquo;&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>On the wedding day, however, Trundle made an effort to assert
himself.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;in high feather and spirits,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, awkwardly pretended to be, but, of course, took
nobody in.&nbsp; Indeed, we are told he was &ldquo;a little
nervous withal.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may be sure he was, and therefore
looking &ldquo;more of an ass&rdquo; than ever.&nbsp; For such
<i>must</i> appear to be a really nervous man in high spirits and
going to be married.&nbsp; All the girls were in tears, Wardle
himself quite broken down, for they knew what was before the poor
child.&nbsp; At the wedding banquet Mr. Pickwick made an
admirable, natural speech, which was greeted with tumults of
applause, and was reported word for word.&nbsp; Then we are told
how Wardle proposed Mr. Pickwick; Mr. Pickwick, the old lady;
Snodgrass, Tupman, the poor relations, all had their speeches;
but there is not a single word of Trundle, who appears to have
been mumchance&mdash;<!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>no one wanted him.&nbsp; In his
speech at the wedding, the amiable Pickwick had, of course, to
give the expected conventional praises to Trundle.&nbsp; But how
guarded he is!&nbsp; &ldquo;God bless &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he says;
&ldquo;my young friend I believe to be a very excellent and manly
fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; I <i>believe</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, he did not
<i>know</i> it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Manly,&rdquo; we might question, for
in manliness he was deficient.&nbsp; We could hear the rustics
below: &ldquo;Squire Trundle manly! he! he! not he!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But on the bride, Mr. Pickwick was enthusiastic: &ldquo;I
<i>know</i> her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be a very, very
amiable and lovely girl; I admire, love, and esteem
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the close he prayed that Wardle&rsquo;s
daughter &ldquo;might enjoy all the happiness that even he could
desire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that he was sure of, but that he could
desire.&nbsp; But Trundle, the cypher, no one thought of him, no
one cared about his speech.&nbsp; Most likely, in his
&ldquo;nervousness,&rdquo; he mumbled forth some indistinct words
which no one could hear, so it was best and most charitable to
pass him by altogether in the report.&nbsp; At the dance at
night, where he surely would have led off the movements, still
not a word of him.&nbsp; And at last, &ldquo;long before Mr.
Pickwick was weary of dancing, the newly-married pair had retired
from the room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Lang fancies that they had gone
upstairs; but I imagine they repaired to their new home close
by.&nbsp; But then, with that minuteness which never fails Boz,
we had been told that they were not to go there till after the
Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>But, after all, one might be inclined to doubt this theory of
the young pair remaining at the house.&nbsp; For do we not find
that on the next day, which was Christmas day, when there was the
going to Church, and the skating and sliding, and Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s immersion, there is no mention of the happy
pair?&nbsp; It looks as though they were at their own home.</p>
<p>After this, many events occurred.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick was
&ldquo;tried&rdquo; and &ldquo;conwicted,&rdquo; as old Weller
has it; was sent to prison and released.&nbsp; On his return from
Birmingham we have some signs of Wardle and his family.&nbsp;
That gentleman was sorely disturbed by Emily&rsquo;s
&ldquo;goings on&rdquo; with Snodgrass, and forecasted another
imprudent marriage like Trundle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He had a suitable
match for her in his eye: &ldquo;a young gentleman down in our
neighbourhood,&rdquo; but Arabella&rsquo;s elopement set the fire
to the powder, and here it <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>is worth
while comparing the marriages of Emily and her sister Isabella as
a test of the relative importance of Snodgrass and this
Trundle.&nbsp; The one took place in London with great show and
pomp, all the family going up specially for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
handsome portion was bestowed on Emily,&rdquo; but there is not a
word to show that Trundle received a halfpenny.</p>
<p>Then followed the scenes at Osborne&rsquo;s Hotel in the
Adelphi, when all was made up and Snodgrass accepted.&nbsp; And
now, at last, we hear something of Trundle.&nbsp; Mrs. T., as we
might expect, was in an &ldquo;interesting way,&rdquo; and had to
be informed of what was going on.&nbsp; But it had to be broken
to her by Trundle, in right of his office.&nbsp; Good, easy
man!&nbsp; We can hear him: &ldquo;the news will be too much for
her&rdquo; (this is on the record).&nbsp; She would insist on
going, and it would be fatal.&nbsp; He would, of course, implore
her not to agitate herself in her present state.&nbsp; As a
matter of course he was all astray.&nbsp; The news was <i>not</i>
too much for her.&nbsp; She ordered at once a cap and a new
dress, and declared that she <i>would</i> go up for the
wedding.&nbsp; The horrified Trundle, who had clearly no
authority whatever, called in the Doctor to exert <i>his</i>,
which he did in this way: by leaving it all to herself.&nbsp; Boz
emphasizes it, by way of contrast to Trundle, saying that
&ldquo;he was a wise and <i>discreet fellow</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the foolish Trundle was put aside; the lady went and
suffered no harm.&nbsp; This proves that Trundle was the <i>mari
de la femme</i>, with no will of his own.</p>
<p>At Dulwich Church, the bridegroom was met &ldquo;by the bride,
the maids, the Winkles, the Wardles, and Trundles,&rdquo; always
to be last and insignificant.&nbsp; In course of time we are told
that Mr. Pickwick was much troubled at first by the numerous
applications made to him to act as Godfather to the offspring of
his friends!&nbsp; These came from Mr. Winkle, Mr. Snodgrass, and
Mr. Trundle.&nbsp; Last of course.&nbsp; Poor soul!&nbsp; We can
see him, grown elderly, sitting at his own table, smiling or
silent, or with an occasional &ldquo;yes, my dear,&rdquo;
&ldquo;certainly, my dear,&rdquo; &ldquo;by all means, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; MUGGLETON AND ITS CRICKET</h2>
<p>The situation and real name of Muggleton has always been a
hotly debated point; many have been the speculations and many the
suggestions as to the original.&nbsp; I was once inclined to
adopt Gravesend, on the statement of the author&rsquo;s daughter,
that, one day, driving with her father towards Cobham, he said
that &ldquo;it was here that Mr. Pickwick dropped his
whip.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cobham would be on the way to Gravesend.</p>
<p>Now what was Muggleton?&nbsp; A large town, with Mayor,
Burgesses, and Freemen&mdash;an ancient and loyal Borough, much
given to petitioning Parliament.&nbsp; It is insinuated that
these petitions were guided by Stiggins-like
instincts&mdash;&ldquo;a zealous advocacy of Christian principles
combined with a devoted attachment to commercial rights.&nbsp;
Hence they were against negro slavery abroad and <i>for</i> the
factory system at home.&nbsp; They were for abolishing Sunday
trading in the streets, and for maintaining the sale of church
livings.&rdquo;&nbsp; A member of Boz&rsquo;s family has assured
me that Maidstone was in the author&rsquo;s mind: it is only some
eight miles from Rochester.&nbsp; But &ldquo;The Bull&rdquo;
waiter informed the Pickwickians that Muggleton was nearly double
the distance, or fifteen miles; while Gravesend is about six
miles from Rochester&mdash;so the evidence of distance does not
help us.&nbsp; Where, too, did Mr. Pickwick drop his whip?&nbsp;
The Pickwickian enthusiast can ascertain this&mdash;&rsquo;an he
will&mdash;by a little calculation.&nbsp; After leaving
&ldquo;The Bull,&rdquo; the tall quadruped exercised his
&ldquo;man&oelig;uvre&rdquo; of darting to the side of the road,
rushing forward for some minutes&mdash;<i>twenty
times</i>&mdash;which would cover about an hour.&nbsp; In the
etching, there is a picture of the spot&mdash;a hedge-lined
road.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick and his friends had to walk the whole
way; yet they arrived late in the afternoon.&nbsp; No one could
walk from Rochester to Maidstone in that time.</p>
<p>It was natural that Mr. Pickwick should drop his
whip&mdash;but most unnatural that he should ask Winkle to
dismount and pick it up for him; <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and most
unnatural of all that Winkle, in his precarious situation, should
consent to dismount.&nbsp; The ordinary course would be that
Tupman or Snodgrass should get down.&nbsp; Then, for the great
marvel of all, we have Mr. Pickwick, who <i>would not</i> get
down, or <i>could not</i> get down to pick up his whip, getting
down to help Mr. Winkle on to his horse!&nbsp; Thus, on the two
occasions, the useless or lazy Tupman and Snodgrass kept their
seats.</p>
<p>It has been claimed&mdash;by the late Charles Dickens the
younger&mdash;that Town Malling was Muggleton, and on the ground
that it has always had a reputation for good cricket.&nbsp; It is
not far from Maidstone.&nbsp; But this is easily disposed
of.&nbsp; Muggleton is described as an important corporate town,
with a Mayor, etc.&nbsp; Further, the cricketing at Muggleton was
of the poorest sort.&nbsp; There was an elderly gentleman playing
who could not stop the balls&mdash;a slim one was hit on the
nose&mdash;they were a set of &ldquo;duffers,&rdquo; in
fact.&nbsp; As for Dickens knowing nothing about cricket, as Mr.
Lang contends, I can say, that he was always interested in
it.&nbsp; I myself have seen him sit the whole day in a marquee,
during a match got up by himself at Gads Hill, marking (or
&ldquo;notching&rdquo;) in the most admirable manner.&nbsp;
Anything he did or described, he did and described according to
the best fashion he could compass.</p>
<p>Wishing, however, to investigate this knotty question
thoroughly, I lately communicated with the Town Clerk of
Maidstone, Mr. Herbert Monckton, who was good enough to search
the Books with reference to certain queries which I
furnished.&nbsp; Dickens states of the mysterious and unnamed
Borough, that it had its Mayor, Burgesses, and
Freemen&mdash;which at once excludes Town Malling which the
younger Charles Dickens had selected.&nbsp; The Clerk has found
that, at the period in question, there were 813 Freemen on the
roll.&nbsp; It has always been held to be &ldquo;an ancient and
loyal Borough,&rdquo; but this, of course, most boroughs of its
standing would claim to be.&nbsp; Boz speaks of innumerable
Petitions to Parliament, and Mr. Monckton tells me that he has
found many petitions in the Books&mdash;one in 1828
<i>against</i> the Licensing Bill, which seems to prove that
Maidstone, like Muggleton, &ldquo;mingled a zealous advocacy of
Christian principles with a devoted attachment to commercial
rights.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then as to the description: Both Maidstone
and Muggleton have an open <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>square for
the market: there are also in both places in the square a fire
office, linendraper, corn factor, saddler, grocer, shoe-shop, but
apparently no distiller.&nbsp; It was curious, certainly, that
there should be an Inn with so odd a sign as the Blue Lion in
Maidstone&mdash;and also a post bearing this sign, in
front.&nbsp; Then as to the cricket, the cricket field was in the
Meadow, Maidstone, not far from the High Street; while at
Muggleton, we are told that Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s friends
&ldquo;had turned out of the main street and were already within
sight of the field of battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here we may admire the wonderful walking powers that Boz
allots to his heroes&mdash;Tupman and Pickwick, who were elderly
persons and stout withal.&nbsp; Fifteen miles to
Muggleton&mdash;two miles further to Manor Farm&mdash;and all
done between eleven o&rsquo;clock, and a period &ldquo;late in
the afternoon&rdquo;&mdash;say five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At a
later visit came the memorable five-and-twenty-mile walk to get
an appetite for dinner.&nbsp; The truth was, such stretches were
as nothing to Boz himself.&nbsp; Walking was his grand pastime
and one absolute necessity.&nbsp; He tramped on with an amazing
energy and vigour, which, as I know from experience, it was
impossible to match.&nbsp; Sometimes he walked the streets for
nearly the whole night.&nbsp; This personal element helps to
explain many things in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; which contains the
early life of Boz.</p>
<h2><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; GOSWELL STREET</h2>
<p>A question that has often exercised ingenious folk is, why did
Mr. Pickwick choose to live in Goswell Street? rather, why did
Boz select such a quarter for him?&nbsp; Of course, at that time,
it was really a &ldquo;genteel&rdquo; neighbourhood, as anyone
can see who walks along the desolate streets and terraces, the
forlorn squares and enclosures that are close by, and where the
New River runs.&nbsp; Nothing is more depressing than the aspect
of these fallen places; but, in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s time, they
had not been very long erected.&nbsp; Indeed, this offers yet
another department which his wonderful Book suggests: that it is
the best record of all the changes that have taken place in
London.&nbsp; This Goswell Street tenancy shows clearly that the
neighbourhood was a desirable one for residents of
position.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick was a City man, and his club met in
Huggin Lane, in the City.&nbsp; He generally put up, or, as Bob
Sawyer had it, &ldquo;hung out,&rdquo; at the &ldquo;George and
Vulture,&rdquo; also in the City.&nbsp; One side of Goswell
Street, in those days&mdash;a road ascending to the old Angel
Inn&mdash;faced, near the top, a number of the pretentious
squares and terraces I have been describing.&nbsp; That
interesting old theatre, Sadler&rsquo;s Wells, was in the rear,
and the New River passed beneath it or beside it, and, quite
uncovered in those days, rippled along on its course from the
country.</p>
<p>All the houses were private houses.&nbsp; Some enthusiasts
have actually identified Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s
apartments&mdash;but without a particle of evidence.&nbsp; Now it
has become a busy thoroughfare, with a noisy tramway: nearly all
the houses have been turned into shops, and Mr. Pickwick could
scarcely recognize his old quarters.&nbsp; The whole region bears
a faded air.&nbsp; Amateurs, who love exploring their London,
will find entertainment in wandering about Islington and the
adjoining districts, experiencing quite a new sensation and
hardly realizing that they are so close to Aldersgate.&nbsp; The
New River itself, which ends its course here, is a pleasant
attraction, with its great basin, and ancient offices by the edge
of the water.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>Imitating Elia, I once set out from here, and followed
its course and its many windings far out into the country, taking
up the journey on successive days, going towards its source in
Hertfordshire, and a most pleasant, interesting voyage of
discovery it was.&nbsp; For it so winds and bends, now passing
through fields and demesnes, now skirting towns and villages,
that it is just as picturesque as any natural stream.&nbsp; Such
being its attractions, Mr. Pickwick was virtually living in the
country or in the suburbs, and enjoying the fine, keen, inspiring
air which the jaded Londoner from lower districts may, even now,
still inhale.&nbsp; There is no Goswell Street now, but Goswell
<i>Road</i>&mdash;a very noisy, clattering thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Another remark to be made is this:&mdash;how much do we owe to
the vivifying power of Boz&rsquo;s descriptions of these old
Towns, Inns, and Streets?&nbsp; The ordinary provincial
town&mdash;unsung and undescribed by him&mdash;remains what it is
and nothing more.&nbsp; York and Manchester stir no memories, and
are unvisited by pilgrims, because <i>they are not in
Pickwick</i>.&nbsp; Boz seems to have found the true
<i>interpretation</i> and inner meaning of each place, and has
actually preserved the tone and flavour that existed in his own
time.&nbsp; This continues even now.&nbsp; As we stroll through
Rochester or Ipswich, Bath or Bury, Pickwick and his friends walk
with us.&nbsp; And, as if well contented to rest under the spell,
these antique towns have made no effort at change, but remain
much as they were.</p>
<p>And this prompts the question: <i>Where did Mrs. Cluppins
live</i>?&nbsp; At the trial we learned that she was a friend and
neighbour of Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s, one of her
<i>comm&egrave;res</i>.&nbsp; She had &ldquo;looked in&rdquo; on
the momentous morning, having been out to purchase &ldquo;kidney
pertaties,&rdquo; yet, on their Hampstead junketting, we find her
coming with the Raddles, in their cab, all the way from Lant
Street, Borough.&nbsp; She was clearly Mrs. Raddle&rsquo;s friend
and neighbour.&nbsp; Perhaps she had moved, though this is not
likely.&nbsp; The household gods of such, like Elia&rsquo;s,
strike a deep root.</p>
<p>In his descriptions of the Bardell party&rsquo;s journey to
Hampstead, which ended so disastrously, the art of Boz is shown
as usual by supplying the notion of movement&mdash;he seems to
take us along up the northern heights&mdash;we feel the
pleasurable anticipations of a party of <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>pleasure for
the lower middle class.&nbsp; From the lower end of Goswell
Street&mdash;where Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s lodgings must have been,
for, in the upper part, there are no houses opposite for Mrs.
Raddle to call at&mdash;it must have been a long drive for the
party.&nbsp; I assume they must have made for Kentish Town, and
toiled up Haverstock Hill at a walk, for the coach was heavily
laden enough.&nbsp; Pleasant Hampstead!&nbsp; One is always glad
to find Boz associating his humour with places that we are deeply
interested in.&nbsp; The Hampstead of this hour, though changed
enough, may remind us very fairly of Boz&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; It
has still the attractions of the old-fashioned, red-brick houses,
and terraces, the mixture of green, and the charming, even
seductive, heath.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Spaniards&rdquo; at
Hampstead&mdash;Boz calls it &ldquo;<i>The</i>
Spaniard&rdquo;&mdash;is scarcely altered from the day of the
Bardell visit, and is as picturesque as ever with its Tea Gardens
and Bowers.&nbsp; I never pass it without seeming to see
Jackson&rsquo;s hackney-coach waiting and the Sheriff&rsquo;s man
at the gate taking his drink.&nbsp; The other Inn, also bound up
with memories of Boz, &ldquo;Jack Straw&rsquo;s Castle,&rdquo;
also stands, but one reads with alarm on this day of grace (June
12th, 1898):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are few Londoners who will not grieve to
hear that the well-known inn on the Spaniards Road, &ldquo;Jack
Straw&rsquo;s Castle,&rdquo; famous as the rendezvous of authors,
artists, statesmen, and many a celebrity of old days, is going
the way of other ancient buildings.&nbsp; The low rooms and
quaint interior of the hostel are now being entirely transformed
and modernised.&nbsp; The only concession made to the prejudices
of the old frequenters of the inn is that the outer face is to be
preserved intact.&nbsp; To the passer by, no great change will
perhaps be apparent; but within, the charm of the place will have
vanished entirely.&nbsp; A spacious saloon bar flooded with
glaring light, with modern furniture and appliances, is to take
the place of the old rooms, coffee-room, billiard-room, and
bar.&nbsp; In fact, it is to become a modern hotel.&nbsp; The
change is quite enough to make the shade of Dickens arise.&nbsp;
As John Forster has told us, the great novelist loved this old
chop-house, and, after a ramble on the Heath, often adjourned
here for a good, wholesome dinner.</p>

<h2><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; MARY HOGARTH</h2>
<p>This young girl&mdash;to whom a touching interest attached
from her being so prematurely cut off&mdash;was a most
interesting creature, one of three sisters, daughters of Mr.
George Hogarth, a Writer to the Signet, who is a sort of link
between Scott and Dickens.&nbsp; For he had acted as the
former&rsquo;s man of business in the Ballantyne disputes, and
must have prompted Dickens in the article that he wrote on that
thorny subject.&nbsp; He was a good musician and a writer in the
magazines.&nbsp; We find his work in the old &ldquo;Monthly
Magazine&rdquo; where Dickens made his <i>d&eacute;but</i>; and
when Boz was installed as editor of
&ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s,&rdquo; we find him admitting much of his
father-in-law&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Memoirs of the
Opera&rdquo; are well-known.&nbsp; There is a charming outline
sketch of Maclise&rsquo;s, showing the profiles of two of the
sisters with Dickens, all three of the most refined and
interesting cast&mdash;but Boz&rsquo;s face is certainly the
handsomest of the three.&nbsp; He must have been a most
attractive young man&mdash;something of the pattern of his own
Nicholas Nickleby.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of the episode is the
reference the author was constantly making to this
bereavement.&nbsp; In the rollicking &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; any
serious introduction of such a topic would have been out of
place: though I fancy a little paragraph in the account of the
Manor Farm Christmas festivities is connected with it.&nbsp; But
about the same time, or rather, some six months later, he was
busy with his &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; and it seems certain
that Rose Maylie was drawn from this sympathetic creature, for
there is a feeling and a passionate grief displayed that could
only be caused by the loss of a person that he had known and
loved.&nbsp; Here is his description of Rose:&mdash;&ldquo;The
younger lady was in the lovely bloom and springtime of womanhood,
at that age when, if ever angels be for God&rsquo;s good <!--
page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be without
impiety supposed to abide in such forms as hers.&nbsp; She was
not <i>past seventeen</i>.&nbsp; Cast in so slight and exquisite
a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth
seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit
companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may compare with this the touching inscription placed by
Dickens on her tomb in Kensal Green: &ldquo;Young, beautiful and
good, God, in His mercy, numbered her among His angels at the
early age of seventeen.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had long planned that he
should be laid beside her, but on Mrs. Hogarth&rsquo;s death,
some five years later, he had to resign his place to her.&nbsp;
This was a renewal of the old grief.&nbsp; The epitaph nearly
seems the epitome of all that he says of Rose Maylie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye,
and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age,
or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and
good humour, the thousand lights that played upon the face and
left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy
smile, were for Home, and fireside peace and
happiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is then described as &ldquo;playfully
putting back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead;
and threw into her beaming look such an expression of affection
and artless loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to
look upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earnestness, the feeling of sincerity thrown into this
description&mdash;the tone of reality&mdash;leave a conviction
that this must have been drawn from a person who had lived and in
whom the writer had the deepest interest.&nbsp; Further, it is
clearly the description of a person who had passed away: of one
who was no longer with him. <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;She was
at the theatre with us on Saturday night, well and happy, and
expired in my arms a few hours afterwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he
wrote to Mr. Cox.</p>
<p>At the end, he returns to the subject, and retouches the
picture:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom
and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in
life the soft and gentle light that fell on all who trod it <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>with her and shone into their hearts; I would paint her
<i>the life and joy of the fireside circle</i>, and the lively
summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at
noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit
evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity
abroad, and the untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I
would summon before me again those joyous little faces that
clustered round her knee; I would recall the tone of that clear
laugh, and conjure up that sympathizing tear that glistened in
the soft, blue eye.&nbsp; These, and a thousand looks and smiles,
and turns of thought and speech, I would fain recall them, every
one.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it is clear that all this is personal, and written of
one that he knew and deeply loved.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Nickleby,&rdquo; there is yet another allusion to
this sad subject&mdash;it is suggested by Kate&rsquo;s grief for
Smike:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is an exquisite and beautiful thing in
our nature that, when the heart is softened and touched by some
tranquil happiness or affectionate feeling, the memory of the
dead comes over it most powerfully and irresistibly.&nbsp; It
would almost seem as though our better thoughts and sympathies
were charms in virtue of which the soul is enabled to hold some
vague and mysterious intercourse with the spirits of those whom
we dearly loved in life.&nbsp; Alas! how often and how long may
these patient angels hover above us, watching for the spell which
is so seldom uttered, and so soon forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is no artificial utterance.&nbsp; He had clearly
interrupted himself to indulge in this sad retrospect.&nbsp; He
then points a moral from Mrs. Nickleby, who, he says, could not
conceive the idea of anyone dwelling on such thoughts in
secret.&nbsp; I have always had a notion that this worthy
lady&rsquo;s incongruities and rambling methods were suggested by
one of his own household, whose imperfection was found to be a
complete lack of sympathy with him in all his feelings.</p>
<p>The devotion of Oliver Twist to Rose, it is not fanciful to
say, was intended to symbolise his own to Mary.&nbsp; We can
recall the passionate, agitated excitement with which
Rose&rsquo;s illness is described&mdash;the hanging on the
doctor&rsquo;s sentence, &amp;c.&mdash;a reminiscence certainly,
and we have only to look at the sketch by Cruikshank of his
friend (given in my &ldquo;<i>Bozland</i>&rdquo;) to recognise
the likeness to Oliver.&nbsp; Oliver&rsquo;s sufferings were his
own.</p>
<p>How tremendous the blow of her death must have been to the
successful writer may be conceived when he did not scruple to
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>interrupt the book and cast it aside altogether from
sheer incapacity to write a line.&nbsp; The June number did not
appear.&nbsp; No one can imagine the inconvenience, the loss, the
enormous risks that were run by taking this step&mdash;the horror
and consternation of the publishers and all concerned.&nbsp; It
proved how indifferent he had become to his prospects and
prosperity when he could hazard such a thing.&nbsp; The first of
the month came round, but no &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
a public catastrophe.&nbsp; When he was able to resume his story,
he found it necessary to issue an explanation in the form of an
address. <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a></p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">186 Strand,<br />
June 30th, 1837.</p>
<p>The author is desirous to take the opportunity afforded him by
the resumption of his work to state, once again, what he thought
had been stated sufficiently emphatically before, namely, that
its publication was interrupted by a severe domestic affliction
of no ordinary kind; that this was the sole cause of the
non-appearance of the present number in its usual course; that,
hereafter, it will continue to be published with its accustomed
regularity.&nbsp; However superfluous this <i>second notice</i>
may appear to many, it is rendered necessary by various idle
speculations and absurdities which have been industriously
propagated during the past month and which have reached the
author&rsquo;s ears from many quarters, and have grieved him
exceedingly.&nbsp; By one set of intimate acquaintances,
especially well-informed, he has been killed outright; by
another, driven mad; by a third, imprisoned for debt; by a
fourth, left per steamer for the United States; by a fifth,
rendered incapable of mental exertion for evermore; by all, in
short, represented as doing anything but seeking by a few
weeks&rsquo; retirement, the restoration of cheerfulness and
peace, of which a sad bereavement has necessarily deprived
him.</p>

69</span>CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; THE PICKWICK CLUB</h2>
<p>This was a common form of social meeting, and we find in the
memoirs of Adolphus and John Taylor and Frederick Reynolds
descriptions of the &ldquo;Keep the Line,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Finish,&rdquo; and other oddly-named societies.&nbsp; The
cheerful glass was the chief object.&nbsp; Mr. Lowten&rsquo;s
Club, &ldquo;The Magpie and Stump,&rdquo; in Clare Market,
supplies a specimen of a lower class club.&nbsp; &ldquo;Veels
vithin veels,&rdquo; as Sam would say.</p>
<p>In his speech at Dulwich, at the close of the book, Mr.
Pickwick spoke rather pathetically of the closing of his
wanderings.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall never forget having devoted the
greater part of two years to mixing with different varieties and
shades of human character, frivolous as my pursuit of novelty may
have appeared to many.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke of the club also, to
which &ldquo;he had communicated both personally and by
letter,&rdquo; acquainting them with his intention of withdrawing
from public life to the country.&nbsp; He added that
&ldquo;during our long absence it had suffered much from internal
dissensions,&rdquo; and this, with other reasons, had obliged him
to dissolve it.&nbsp; This &ldquo;absence,&rdquo; both as planned
and carried out, was merely occasional.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick and
his friends were rarely, and only now and then, absent from town,
going away for short spells, save, of course, the enforced
absence in the Fleet Prison and the months or weeks (as it may
be) in Bath.&nbsp; &ldquo;The George and Vulture&rdquo; was not
far from Huggin Lane, so Mr. Pickwick must have been constantly
at the Club, or <i>could</i> have been had he chosen to go
there.&nbsp; All this notion of severance, therefore, was
somewhat sentimental.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>But the &ldquo;dissensions&rdquo; the President spoke of
were natural enough.&nbsp; He was the founder and mainstay of the
association&mdash;probably paid its expenses.&nbsp; The whole
object of the institution, it may be suspected, was to exalt the
founder.&nbsp; In such a state of things, it was natural that
there should be an opposition, or discontented party, headed by
&ldquo;that Blotton.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Blotton was got rid of,
his friends would think that he had been badly treated and take
advantage of the occasional absences of the chief to foment
revolt.&nbsp; Then Blotton was expelled, assuredly unfairly, for
he merely took the opposite view on the Cobham stone, and he
might have left some who belonged to his faction and who thought
he had been harshly dealt with.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick, in fact,
merely returned from his agreeable junketting to have this
gentleman expelled.&nbsp; Despotism of this sort always leads to
discontent and parties&mdash;hence the
&ldquo;dissensions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick, from his treatment
of Blotton, must have been a Tory of the old Eldon school.&nbsp;
Here was his blemish.&nbsp; He had no toleration for others, and
had an undue idea of his own position.&nbsp; We can trace the
whole thing perfectly.&nbsp; He was a successful man of
business&mdash;an export merchant apparently&mdash;being
connected with an agent at Liverpool whom he had
&ldquo;obliged.&rdquo;&nbsp; Round such a man who was
good-natured and philanthropic would gather flatterers and
toadies; hence the suggestion to found a club with his own name
and &ldquo;button.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this he could be
&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; and he was listened to and courted.&nbsp; It
was like the devotion of satellites to the late Mr.
Gladstone.&nbsp; We can see all this in the picture of the club
at the beginning, where, with the exception of the four
legitimate Pickwickians, all seem rather of the tradesman class,
and are vulgar types enough.&nbsp; In such surroundings, Mr.
Pickwick could &ldquo;rule the roast&rdquo; and grow despotic and
even arrogant.</p>
<p>Blotton, however, who seems to have been an independent sort
of fellow, could not submit to this, was of the Opposition, and,
no doubt, a thorn in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; And here is
yet another point of the likeness to the Johnsonian
coterie.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Club,&rdquo; Hawkins&mdash;Sir John
of that ilk&mdash;was uncongenial&mdash;&ldquo;a detestable
fellow,&rdquo; Bozzy calls him&mdash;objecting, quarrelling, and,
at last, on one occasion was so rude that he had to
withdraw.&nbsp; Now, that this offence was rankling is <!-- page
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>evident, and it explains the fracas which took place at
the opening.&nbsp; Blotton looked on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
travelling as pure humbug.&nbsp; The idea of his contributing
anything useful or instructive in his so-called reports seemed
nonsense.&nbsp; Further, was it not something of a job?&nbsp;
Pickwick was taking three of his own special
&ldquo;creatures&rdquo; with him&mdash;Winkle, to whom he had
been appointed governor; Snodgrass, who was his ward; and Tupman,
who was his butt and toady.&nbsp; They were the <i>gentlemen</i>
of the club.&nbsp; None of the outsiders were chosen.&nbsp; From
Blotton&rsquo;s behaviour, too, on the Cobham business, it is
clear he thought Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s scientific researches were
also &ldquo;humbug.&rdquo;&nbsp; A paper by that gentleman had
just been read&mdash;&ldquo;The tracing of the source of the
ponds at Hampstead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Some observations on the
theory of tittlebats.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was somewhat too much of
this &ldquo;bossing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole report read by the
secretary was full of gross flatteries.&nbsp; They had
&ldquo;just heard read with feelings of unmingled satisfaction
and unqualified approval,&rdquo; &amp;c., &ldquo;from which
advantages must accrue to the cause of science&rdquo;&mdash;cause
of rubbish!&nbsp; Then, it added, obsequiously, something about
&ldquo;the <i>inestimable</i> benefits from carrying the
speculations of that <i>learned</i> man&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick, in his speech, was certainly self-laudatory and
provocative.&nbsp; He talked of his pride in promoting the
Tittlebatian theory, and &ldquo;let <i>his enemies make the most
of it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was marked enough, and no doubt
caused looks at Blotton.&nbsp; Then he began to puff his new
enterprise at &ldquo;a service of some danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were, were there not, upsets of coaches &ldquo;in all
directions,&rdquo; horses bolting&mdash;boats overturning, and
boilers bursting?&nbsp; Now, Blotton&mdash;after all the humbug
that had gone before, and particularly after a provocative
reference to himself&mdash;could not stand this, and, amid the
obsequious cries and &ldquo;cheers,&rdquo; said, boldly,
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; (A Voice: &ldquo;No!&rdquo;)&nbsp; That
is, signifying there were no such dangers.&nbsp; The fury of the
orator on &ldquo;the Windsor chair,&rdquo; was quite
Gladstonian.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried; on which the
cheers of his followers broke out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who was it that
cried No?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he proceeded to imagine it came from
some &ldquo;vain and disappointed man&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t say
haberdasher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the Pickwick Club there was a Vice-President, named
Smiggers&mdash;Joseph Smiggers, Esq., P.V.P.M.P.C., that is,
Perpetual <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Vice-President and Member of the
Pickwick Club.&nbsp; Smiggers was, of course, supposed to be
&ldquo;Pickwick&rsquo;s creature,&rdquo; or he would not have
been there.&nbsp; He was a tall, corpulent man, with a soft
face&mdash;as we see him in his picture.&nbsp; As Mr. Pickwick
speaks, it is remarkable that both Vice-President and
Secretary&mdash;the two officers&mdash;have each one arm raised
as if in ecstatic rapture&mdash;clear proof of their subservience
to Pickwick.&nbsp; On Smiggers&rsquo; right is a
&ldquo;doddering&rdquo; old fellow of between seventy and
eighty&mdash;clearly a &ldquo;nullity&rdquo;&mdash;on his left,
another member nearly as old, but with a glimmer of
intelligence.&nbsp; Down the side of the table, facing the
orator, are some odd faces&mdash;one clearly a Jew; one for whom
the present Mr. Edward Terry might have sat.&nbsp; Blotton is at
the bottom, half turned away in disgust.&nbsp; His neighbour
looks at him with wonder, as who should say, &ldquo;How can you
be so insensible?&rdquo;&nbsp; Odd to say&mdash;and significant,
too&mdash;Blotton has brought into the club his <i>dog</i>, a
ferocious looking &ldquo;bull,&rdquo; which sits at his feet
under the table.&nbsp; We should say, on the whole, that Blotton
could only count on&mdash;and that, with but a limited
sympathy&mdash;the Terry-faced and Jew-faced men&mdash;if he
<i>could</i> count on them.&nbsp; The Secretary was like a
clerk&mdash;a perky fellow&mdash;and had a pen behind his ear;
probably in some Bank or Counting House, so strong is
habit.&nbsp; One member of the Club alone is invisible&mdash;the
one beyond Tupman&mdash;all that is seen of him is a hand holding
a tumbler as if about to drink.&nbsp; The Dodderer is applauding;
so are the Jew, Blotton and Tupman; so is the round-faced man,
just beyond the invisible one.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick and his three friends being removed or absent,
and Blotton expelled, out of the fourteen members there were left
but nine, whereof we reckon four or five as Pickwickians and the
rest as <i>Blottonites</i>.</p>
<p>And how easily can we imagine the acrimonious discussions that
went on!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This &rsquo;ere Pickwick, who was always making the
club a hend to his own glorification, had gone off on his touring
to get more grist for his mill.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was really, a
&ldquo;mutual admiration society,&rdquo; and as for the reports,
notes, &amp;c., he was sending back &ldquo;they &rsquo;ad
&rsquo;ad enough of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The club didn&rsquo;t meet
to be listening to long-winded yarns to be read out by their
worthy secretary, but for a glass and social intercourse.&nbsp;
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>As for the &ldquo;travels and preambulations,&rdquo;
what were they more than visits to genteel &rsquo;ouses where
Pickwick was &ldquo;showing oft&rdquo; at their expense?&nbsp;
Then where were the &ldquo;Sportin&rsquo;
transactions?&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole thing was
&ldquo;rot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the Cobham stone business, at which
the whole town was laughing, and which their worthy friend
Blotton had exposed.&nbsp; Blotton was the only long-headed,
creditable man they had.&nbsp; <i>He</i> ought to have been their
president.&nbsp; But he had been turned out by the
&ldquo;<i>lick-spittles</i>&rdquo; of the society.</p>

74</span>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; ROADSIDE INNS</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;The Bell at Berkeley Heath</h3>
<p>In the animated journey, from Bristol to Birmingham, the
travellers stopped at various posting-houses where the mercurial
Sawyer would insist on getting down to lunch, dine, or otherwise
refresh&mdash;his friends being always ready to comply after a
little decent hesitation.&nbsp; It was thus that they drew up at
The Bell at Berkeley Heath, which our writer presently
sketches.&nbsp; It will be seen there is more of the drink at the
Bell than of the Bell itself.&nbsp; It is, indeed, no more than
<i>c&oelig;cum nomen</i>&mdash;much as though we read the name at
the end of &ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo;&mdash;yet, somehow, from the
life and movement of the journey, it offers a sort of attraction:
it seems familiar, and we have an interest in it.&nbsp; The Bell
now &ldquo;goes on,&rdquo; as the proprietor tells me.&nbsp;
There are travellers who come there and drink Boz&rsquo;s health
in the snug parlour.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a Pickwickian Inn, and
is drawn within the glamour of the legend, and, what a marvel!
the thing is done by the magic of those three or four
lines.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bell,&rdquo; says Mrs. Hooper,
&ldquo;lies back on the main road from Bristol to Gloucester, and
is just nineteen miles from Bristol.&nbsp; It is a rambling old
house and a good deal dilapidated, and of good age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this meagre record it yet offers such Pickwickian
interest that, not many months ago, a photograph was taken of it
which was engraved for the <i>Daily Graphic</i>.&nbsp; There is
no Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s room to be shown, as undoubtedly there
<i>would</i> be had that gentleman only stayed the night there;
but he only lunched and then went forward.&nbsp; There is a
mistiness as to whether the Pickwickians sat in the public
coffee-room or had a private
&ldquo;settin&rsquo;-room.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to a certainty the
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>coffee-room, as they only stayed a short time.&nbsp; So
the proprietor, with a safe conscience, might exhibit &ldquo;the
room where Mr. Pickwick lunched.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the face is
imbedded a tablet bearing the date 1729, and there is an ancient
farmer close by who was born in &ldquo;The Bell&rdquo; in the
year 1820.&nbsp; If we lend ourselves properly to the delusion,
he might recall Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s chaise drawing up full sixty
years ago.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, I mind it well.&nbsp; I were joost
then fifteen.&nbsp; A stoutish gent in gaiters&mdash;might
&rsquo;ave been a bishop&mdash;and sich a lively young chap as
wos with him, full o&rsquo; spirits, chucking a&rsquo; the gurls
under the chins.&nbsp; And their sarvant!&nbsp; O <i>he</i> were
one.&nbsp; Sam, he were caa&rsquo;d&mdash;I moind that&mdash;Sam
Summut.&nbsp; And they caa&rsquo;d for the best o&rsquo;
everythin&rsquo;, and took away wi&rsquo; them a lot, Madeary,
and wot not,&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;The Greyhound, Dulwich</h3>
<p>Mr. Pickwick, as we know, at the close of his wanderings
retired to this tranquil and pleasant suburb&mdash;then much more
retired than it is now.&nbsp; In accordance with his habit of
enshrining his own personal sympathies in his writing, Boz was,
as it were, conveying that it was such a sequestered spot as he
himself would choose under similar conditions.&nbsp; Last year
(1898), the interesting old road-side Inn, The Greyhound, was
levelled&mdash;an Inn to which Mr. Pickwick must have found his
way in the dull evening to drink &ldquo;cold Punch&rdquo; or
preside at the club which he most certainly&mdash;if we know him
well&mdash;must have founded.&nbsp; A wealthy gentleman of social
tastes, and with a love for tavern life, would have no difficulty
in establishing a new Pickwick Club.</p>
<p>At the Greyhound, nigh a century ago, there was actually a
club which entertained Tom Campbell, Mark Lemon, Byron&rsquo;s
tutor, and many more.&nbsp; Boz himself, we are told, used to
find his way there with Theodore Hook, Moore, and others.&nbsp;
Boz, therefore, must have regarded this place with much favour,
owing to his own experiences of it&mdash;and to have selected it
for his hero&rsquo;s tranquil old age shows how high a place it
had in his memory.&nbsp; The description is charming and brings
this sylvan retreat to which we have walked many a time perfectly
before us.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>This taste for surrounding himself with persons of lower
degree&mdash;such as were the rank and file&mdash;was curiously
enough shared by Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s predecessor, Dr. Johnson,
who, when he found the Literary Club somewhat too much of a
republic, and getting &ldquo;out of hand,&rdquo; established a
social meeting at the Essex Head Club&mdash;in the street of that
name, off the Strand&mdash;composed in the main of respectable
tradesmen, who would listen obsequiously.&nbsp; Thus, it may be
repeated, does the same sort of character develop invariably on
the same lines, and thus did Mr. Pickwick unconsciously follow in
the footsteps of the &ldquo;great Lexicographer.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Grimaldi the Younger</h3>
<p>As I was the first to point out, the powerful
&ldquo;Stroller&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; of which Boz himself thought
so highly, was founded on the career of the unfortunate son of
the great Grimaldi.&nbsp; The story is related by &ldquo;Dismal
Jemmy,&rdquo; the actor, who, in the tale itself, is called
Hutley, and it corresponds in all its details with
Grimaldi&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; He died in September, 1832,
nearly four years before Pickwick was thought of, but Boz had
learned the incident long before the Grimaldi MSS. were given him
to edit, and I am inclined to think he must have learned them
from his friend Harley who was intimate with the Grimaldis.&nbsp;
In the memoirs it is stated that Gledinning, a Printer, was sent
by the father to his son&rsquo;s dying bed, and he was probably
the Hutley of the Stroller&rsquo;s Tale, and, perhaps, the person
who brought old Grimaldi the news of his death.&nbsp; We are told
in the &ldquo;Tale&rdquo; that he had an engagement &ldquo;at one
of the Theatres on the Surrey side of the water,&rdquo; and in
the memoirs we find that he was offered &ldquo;an engagement for
the Christmas at the Coburg.&rdquo;&nbsp; There his death is
described:&mdash;&ldquo;He rose in bed, drew up his withered
limbs&mdash;he was acting&mdash;he was at the Theatre.&nbsp; He
then sang some roaring song.&nbsp; The walls were alive with
reptiles, frightful figures flitted to and fro . . .&nbsp; His
eyes shone with a lustre frightful to behold, the lips were
parched and cracked, the dry, hard skin glowed with a burning
heat, and there was an almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in
the man&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hutley also describes how he
had to hold him down in his bed.&nbsp; Compare with <!-- page
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>this
the account in the memoirs&mdash;&ldquo;his body was covered with
a fearful inflammation&mdash;he died in a state of wild and
furious madness, rising from his bed, dressing himself in stage
costume to act snatches of the parts, and requiring to be held
down to die by strong manual force.&rdquo;&nbsp; This dreadful
scene took place at a public house in Pitt Street, out of
Tottenham Court Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man I speak of,&rdquo; says Boz in the story,
&ldquo;was a low, pantomime actor and an habitual drunkard.&nbsp;
In his better days he had been in the receipt of a good
salary.&nbsp; His besetting sin gained so fast on him that it was
found impossible to employ him in the situations in which he
really was useful.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the &ldquo;memoirs&rdquo; this
is more than supported: &ldquo;The man who might have earned with
ease and comfort from six to seven hundred a year, was reduced to
such a dreadful state of destitution and filth . . .&nbsp; In
fact, at one time, it was thought he might have succeeded his
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is quite plain, therefore, that Boz was recalling this
tragic episode.&nbsp; Boz remarks that pantomime
actors&mdash;clowns and others &ldquo;either die early or, by
unnaturally taxing their bodily energies, lose prematurely their
physical powers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was what occurred to Grimaldi,
the father, whose curious decay he was to describe later in the
memoirs.&nbsp; It may be added that there is an Alderman Harmer,
Hatton Garden, mentioned in the memoirs, with whom Grimaldi
<i>p&egrave;re</i> had some dealings; and, long after, this name
was introduced by Boz into &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; MR. PICKWICK&rsquo;S PROTOTYPE</h2>
<p>We had a narrow escape of losing our Pickwick and his familiar
type.&nbsp; The original notion was to have &ldquo;a tall, long,
thin man,&rdquo; and only for the late Edward Chapman, who
providentially thought of the Richmond gentleman, Foster, we
should have lost for ever the short, rotund Pickwick that we so
love and cherish.&nbsp; A long, thin Pickwick!&nbsp; He could not
be amiable, or benevolent, or mild, or genial.&nbsp; But what
<i>could</i> such a selection mean?&nbsp; Why, that Boz saw an
opening for humorous treatment in introducing a purblind, foolish
Professor, or scientist&mdash;one with spectacles&mdash;prying
into this and that, taking notes &amp;c.&nbsp; As Winkle was the
sportsman, Tupman, the lover, Snodgrass, the poet, so Mr.
Pickwick was to be a sort of Pangloss or Dominie Sampson.&nbsp;
His curiosity and love of enquiry were to get him into scrapes,
just as Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s sham sportsmanship was to get him into
embarrassments.&nbsp; In fact, the first appearance in
Seymour&rsquo;s plate&mdash;the scene with the cabman&mdash;shows
him as quite a different Pickwick; with a sour, cantankerous
face; not in &ldquo;tights,&rdquo; but in a great coat; he is
scarcely recognisable.&nbsp; Seymour was then determined to show
him after his own ideal.&nbsp; But when the poor artist destroyed
himself the great man was brought up to the fitting type.&nbsp;
So undecided were the parties about that type that the author had
to leave it altogether an open question&mdash;a <i>tabula
rasa</i>&mdash;not announcing that his hero was either tall or
short, fat or lean, pale or rosy; all he commits himself to in
his opening chapter is that he was bald, that he wore tights and
gaiters, and, what is rather singular, <i>circular
spectacles</i>.&nbsp; I suppose, in contrast to the more
elongated glasses.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>It might be an interesting question for the &ldquo;paper
of questions,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did Mr. Pickwick wear circular
spectacles?&rdquo;&nbsp; Was there any local weakness?&nbsp; The
artist never forgot this direction.&nbsp; In the author of the
Tittlebatian system, &amp;c., the &ldquo;circular
spectacles&rdquo; would impart a sort of wise and owl-like
stare.&nbsp; It was, of course, due to Chapman, the publisher,
and was another of his &ldquo;happy suggestions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Mr. Foster, of Richmond&mdash;fortunately for
himself&mdash;was not known to be the original of
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; though many must have been struck by the
likeness, both in physique and costume, to the picture.&nbsp; It
is not stated that the features were copied, though, no doubt,
Chapman would have vividly described them also; and Seymour was
so ready and deft with his pencil that he must have certainly
caught the likeness even from the description.&nbsp; We could
fancy him rapidly making trial sketches, &ldquo;Is that near
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, fatter in the cheeks.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is <i>that</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, forehead a little
higher, more bald,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; I myself was at
Richmond, having just come from school, about ten years after the
appearance of Pickwick&mdash;and for aught I know may have seen
this Foster promenading it on the Hill.&nbsp; There was no
particular interest then in Pickwick&mdash;which was somewhat
forgotten, the interest being absorbed in the newer and brilliant
works which Boz was bringing out.&nbsp; The society there was
thoroughly Pickwickian; there were many old-fashioned figures,
including the Mr. Jesse at whom the &ldquo;Ponto&rdquo; story was
directed.&nbsp; We were gay enough.&nbsp; The old Star and Garter
was flourishing.&nbsp; There were the Assembly Rooms at the
Castle Inn, with &ldquo;Almack&rsquo;s Balls&rdquo;; barges
coming down on Regatta days, when people danced on the deck and
feasted in the cabin.&nbsp; There were private parties and
dinners, and the old Theatre&mdash;Kean&rsquo;s, with the
manager&rsquo;s house adjoining&mdash;was still standing on the
Green, opening fitfully enough for a few nights, and then closing
as fitfully.&nbsp; There I saw &ldquo;The Green
Bushes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a little Bandbox as it was!&nbsp; There
were the two wooden staircases <i>outside</i>, of quaint
appearance.&nbsp; Mr. Tupman may have been then alive and walking
on the Terrace.&nbsp; He had retired there just twenty years
before.&nbsp; He had probably rooms on the Green, near Maid of
Honour Row.&nbsp; This little sketch shows clearly that Richmond
is very nearly <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>associated with Pickwick.&nbsp; But
here comes in another reminiscence of Richmond, for there rises
before me, about a dozen years after the appearance of the book,
the image of a very Pickwickian figure&mdash;bald and
&ldquo;circular,&rdquo; cozy, wearing a white tie and
glasses&mdash;a favourite gossip with all the ladies&mdash;no
other indeed than Maria Edgworth&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; He was a
florid, good-humoured personage, a great talker, knew everybody
in the place, and, like Mr. Pickwick, was an old bachelor, and
kept an important housekeeper.&nbsp; He was genial and
hospitable, would give parties, dinners, and dances.&nbsp; But
the likeness in physique was the oddest part.</p>
<p>As the outside of Foster, of Richmond, supplied Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s outside and habit as he lived, so his
&ldquo;in&rsquo;ards,&rdquo; or character, was also turned to
profit and not wasted.&nbsp; And here suggests itself a very
likely speculation.&nbsp; This image of the Richmond Foster was
before him; through the book he thought of the old Beau and the
ladies&rsquo; protests.&nbsp; The amorous element would not do
for his hero, for whom he had other work; but while he left the
physique to Pickwick he certainly transferred the
<i>character</i> to one of his leading figures.&nbsp; That this
is not fanciful will be seen.&nbsp; Mr. Chapman described Foster
as &ldquo;a fat old Beau&rdquo;: he was very popular, or, it may
be, exceedingly well off.&nbsp; And at a place like Richmond he
would be very <i>recherch&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; But is it not
exactly suggestive of Tupman&mdash;this &ldquo;fat old
Beau&rdquo; devoted to the ladies?&nbsp; (&ldquo;Because you are
too old, sir; and too fat, sir,&rdquo; said his chief.)&nbsp; And
on the first opportunity he <i>did</i> get into tights, viz., as
the brigand.&nbsp; What is more convincing is that at the close
Boz sent Tupman back to Richmond whence he came, and where we are
carefully assured &ldquo;he walks constantly on the Terrace
during the summer months with a youthful and jaunty air which has
rendered him the admiration of the numerous elderly dames of
single condition who reside in the vicinity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing
Mr. Foster&rsquo;s occupation, I really think that this accounts
for the novelist&rsquo;s selection of Richmond.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman recalled that not even the persuasion of the
Richmond ladies could induce Mr. Foster, of Richmond, to forego
his &ldquo;tights&rdquo; and gaiters&mdash;and much amusement was
caused by the idiosyncrasy.&nbsp; This persistence, it is clear,
was before Boz, who makes Mr. Pickwick abandon his gaiters only
at the Ball at Manor Farm, <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>but we are
distinctly told &ldquo;that it was the first time&rdquo; he did
so &ldquo;within the memory of his oldest friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus we have Foster, of Richmond, brought into actual touch with
his double.&nbsp; Thus much for his physique, which, it is
admitted, was all that was drawn from Foster.&nbsp; But that
friendly manner; that genial, amiable nature which made him think
&ldquo;the whole world akin;&rdquo; whence did Boz import all
that?&nbsp; I believe he found this genial, friendly type in the
very man who had suggested Foster, of Richmond, to him.&nbsp;
That this is not purely fanciful will be seen from an account of
Edward Chapman kindly supplied to me by one of his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a short, stoutish person, very good-humoured, an
affectionate family man, unaffected, and fond of the
country.&nbsp; But touching his character; the first feature that
came into my mind was his extreme justice; in my very earliest
years I remember being impressed by it&mdash;one <i>felt</i> it:
all actions and motives were judged with a catholicity and
charity that made us trust him implicity, and I see my sister has
the same remembrance.&nbsp; He was naturally of a quiet, easy
disposition; not much of a talker, but when he spoke he was
always worth listening to.&nbsp; I see also she mentions his
sense of humour, when his eyes would light up with a merry
twinkle.&nbsp; I never remember hearing him say an unkind word to
anyone.&nbsp; It is very pleasant to hear that papa is to be
mentioned in connection with Pickwick, and I will gladly tell you
all I can regarding my impressions of his character and tastes,
&amp;c.&nbsp; We only saw him for a short hour in the evening
when he was tired after his day&rsquo;s work and little inclined
to talk, but we always had a child-like instinct of his great
justice and impartiality&mdash;an impression that I retained all
through his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on, at Tunbridge Wells, where we saw more of him,
I learned to admire his vast store of knowledge, as there was
hardly a subject that I asked for information on that he did not
know a great deal about.&nbsp; Also he had a great love of beauty
in nature, and was never so happy as when he had his favourite,
shabby old hat on and a long stick, which he had cut himself, in
his hand, and poked about the grounds which surrounded our house,
inspecting the holly hedge and shrubs he had planted&mdash;in
fact it used to be a standing joke that he <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>used to
measure his holly bushes every day to see how much they had grown
in the night.&nbsp; He was perfectly happy in such a life, as it
suited his peaceful contented nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a man who never used a rough word to anyone, but
his remarks, if he were angry, could sting sharply.&nbsp; He had
a fund of quiet humour, like a Scotchman, and his sallies told
all the more, as they generally came when least expected and
without an effort.&nbsp; Later on, I travelled with my mother and
him for several years and benefited greatly through his knowledge
and love of art, and his recognition and appreciation of all that
was good and worthy of admiration in foreign lands and
peoples.&nbsp; He had a soft heart, too, and was always ready to
help those who asked for aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next is introduced the prototype of Mr. Pickwick in a few
touches:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an old family friend living at Richmond,
named John Foster, <i>not Forster</i>, who was quite a character,
especially in his personal appearance; it occurred to my father
to introduce him to Dickens who had just commenced the Pickwick
Papers.&nbsp; Accordingly, they were invited to meet one another
at dinner, and, from this copy, Dickens turned out Pickwick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trial in Pickwick was not originally written as it
is given to the public.&nbsp; The number was just coming out and
in the hands of &ldquo;the reader&rdquo; (I believe John Forster
was my father&rsquo;s reader at that time, and had been educated
for the Bar), when the following occurred: Dickens was going to
dine that evening at my father&rsquo;s house; they were waiting
for dinner to be announced, when a messenger came in a great
hurry (I think it must have been from the reader) to say that
Dickens was wrong on a point of law, and that something must be
done at once as the number was on the eve of publication, and the
printers were waiting.&nbsp; They rang the bell, ordered dinner
to be put back, and placed pen and paper before Dickens who set
to work at once and re-wrote part of the trial, there and then;
it was given to the messenger waiting in the hall, and Dickens
sat down to dinner with a comfortable feeling that the
publication had been saved in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given these anecdotes as we remember hearing
them <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>spoken about in our home.&nbsp; I can picture the last
one so well, the rapidity with which it was done, the young
author, my parents, and the pretty home in which it took
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s marriage was a romantic one.&nbsp;
Visiting at Hitchin, he fell in love with his next door
neighbour, a very pretty little Quakeress, dressed in the Quaker
fashion of those days; her father was a very strict Friend, and
was made very uneasy at the attentions of this London lover; but
Mary was bright and vivacious, and encouraged him, and many were
the interviews contrived by the young couple.&nbsp; Their rooms
were on the same floor, though in different houses; my father,
behind a piece of furniture, bored a hole through the dividing
wall, and the lovers slipped notes backwards and forwards by this
means.&nbsp; I am not aware that the simple-hearted parents ever
found it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, at last, Mary was persuaded to leave her sheltered
home and launch out into the world by his side.&nbsp; They were
married in the north of England, from her brother&rsquo;s house;
the bridegroom sending from London, the day before the marriage,
the dresses the little Quakeress was to robe herself in when she
slipped out of her garb.&nbsp; The fit must have been greatly
left to chance!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being full of tact and of engaging manners, she proved
an excellent hostess, and well fitted for the position she
held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father died 20th February, 1880, aged 76, and was
buried at Hitchin, beside my mother.&nbsp; He had long retired
from business, and spent many years abroad on account of my
mother&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pleasing sketch quite suggests the account given by
Sterne of his father.&nbsp; There is a quaint, old-world air
about it&mdash;and the traits are really those of Mr. Pickwick in
his later development.&nbsp; We could imagine the latter at
Dulwich examining and measuring his holly bushes.&nbsp; It would
not be too fanciful to suppose that Boz&mdash;constantly with
him, dining with him, and consulting him on every
point&mdash;must have been impressed, and influenced too, by
those amiable qualities, particularly by that unaffected
simplicity and good-will which is also so notable in his
hero.&nbsp; So the figure stands thus&mdash;first, the long, thin
man with Dry-as-dust tastes: then the short, round
philanthropist, whose externals were suggested by the Foster, of
Richmond, <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>the latter&rsquo;s
&ldquo;internals&rdquo; being transferred to Tupman.&nbsp; Not
only do &ldquo;Vith and Visdom&rdquo; go together, but also
&ldquo;Vith&rdquo; and good humour and benevolence, which Boz
felt were necessary adjuncts to such a physique.&nbsp; Where was
he to find these?&nbsp; Now, we know how much Boz was inclined to
draw from what was before his eyes.&nbsp; It saved him trouble
and also set his imagination at work.&nbsp; The Cheeryble
Brothers, each a <i>Pickwick redivivus</i>, were taken from the
Grant Brothers, merchants, at Manchester.&nbsp; And here he had
this very exceptional character daily before him, in the person
of Edward Chapman. <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"

85</span>CHAPTER XII.&nbsp; THE CALVERLEY EXAMINATION PAPER</h2>
<p>Few things have been more interesting to the Pickwickian, or
have done more to elevate Pickwickian study, than this celebrated
<i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>.&nbsp; Calverley, or Blayds&mdash;his
original name&mdash;was a brilliant creature, well known for his
scholarship, verses, and sayings.&nbsp; He early obtained a
fellowship at Cambridge, and was one of the youngest
&ldquo;Dons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like Dr. Thomson, the celebrated
Master, he is felt to be a characteristic and a real personage,
even by those little familiar with his work or writings.&nbsp; He
was, moreover, an ardent Pickwickian and thoroughly saturated
with the spirit of the immortal book, to appreciate which a
first-rate memory, which he possessed, is essential; for the
details, allusions, names, suggestions, are so immense that they
require to be present together in the mind, and jostle each other
out of recollection.&nbsp; In the &rsquo;fifties, there were at
Cambridge a number of persons interested in the Book, who were
fond of quoting it and detecting oddities.&nbsp; It was in the
year 1858 or 1859&mdash;for, curious to say, the year cannot be
fixed&mdash;that Calverley conceived the <i>bizarre</i> idea of
offering a premium for the best answers to a series of searching
examination questions, drawn from this classic.&nbsp; It was held
at his own rooms at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the evening, as Sir Walter
Besant, one of the candidates, recalls it.&nbsp; There were about
a dozen entered, the most formidable of whom were Skeat, the
present professor of Anglo-Saxon, a well-known Chaucerian
scholar, and Sir Walter Besant aforesaid.&nbsp; The latter
describes the scene in very dramatic fashion&mdash;the Examiner,
in his gown, cap, and hood, gravely walking up and down during
the two <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>hours the examination lasted, going
through the ceremonial with all the regular solemnity of the
Senate House.&nbsp; The candidates, we are told, expected a sort
of jocose business, and were little prepared for the
&ldquo;stiffness&rdquo; of the questions which were of the deep
and searching kind they were accustomed to in the case of a Greek
Play or a Latin Epic.&nbsp; Almost at once, three-fourths showed
by their helpless bewilderment that the thing was beyond them;
and the struggle lay between the two well-versed
Pickwickians&mdash;Besant and Skeat.&nbsp; The latter was known
to have his &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; at his fingers&rsquo; ends,
and Besant confessed that he had but small hopes of
success.&nbsp; Both plodded steadily through the long list of
questions.&nbsp; It should be said that the competition was open
only to members of Christ Church College, which thus excluded the
greatest reputed Pickwickian of them all, John Lempri&egrave;re
Hammond&mdash;the name, by the way, of the &ldquo;creator&rdquo;
of Sam Weller on the stage.&nbsp; Besant went steadily through
his list of questions to the end, revised his answers, and got
his paper ready for delivery, but Skeat worked on to the very
last moment.&nbsp; An evening or two later, as they were going
into Hall, Calverley pinned up his report on the board at the
door just like one of the usual University reports, and there was
read the result:&mdash;</p>
<p>Besant . . . 1st Prize</p>
<p>Skeat . . . 2nd Prize</p>
<p>The authorities were not a little shocked at a liberty which
assumed the aspect of a burlesque of their own proceedings, and
Calverley was spoken to gently by a Don of the older
school.&nbsp; The paper of questions certainly shows what ability
may be brought to bear on so trifling a matter; for there is
really a power of analysis and a grasp of &ldquo;inner
meaning&rdquo; that is most remarkable.&nbsp; Sir Walter has very
acutely commented on this little &ldquo;exercise,&rdquo; and has
shown that it reached much higher than a mere jest.&nbsp; It
brought out the extraordinary capacities of the book which have
exercised so many minds.&nbsp; For &ldquo;The Pickwick
Examination,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was not altogether a
burlesque of a college examination; it was a very real and
searching examination in a book which, brimful as it is of
merriment, mirth, and wit, is just as intensely human as a book
can be.&nbsp; The characters are not puppets in a farce, stuck up
only to be knocked down: they are men and <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>women.&nbsp;
Page after page, they show their true characters and reveal
themselves; they are consistent; even when they are most absurd
they are most real; we learn to love them.&nbsp; It is a really
serious test paper; no one could answer any of it who had not
read and re-read the Pickwick Papers, and acquired, so to speak,
a mastery of the subject.&nbsp; No one could do well in the
examination who had not gone much further than this and got to
know the book almost by heart.&nbsp; It was a most wonderful
burlesque of the ordinary College and Senate House examination,
considering the subject from every possible point of view.&nbsp;
Especially is it rich in the department then dear to Cambridge:
the explanation of words, phrases, and idioms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of these cruxes, Sir Walter tells us, could not be solved
by the examiner, and were laid before Boz himself, with a copy of
the questions.&nbsp; Needless to say, Boz was infinitely amused,
but, to the general disappointment, could or would give no
information.&nbsp; The answer of Browning on a similar appeal is
well known&mdash;he referred his questioners to the Browning
Society, as knowing as much as he did on the point.&nbsp; There
is no doubt that this is the true philosophy of the thing: that,
once his ideas are in print, the author has no more to do with
them or their meaning than anyone else has.&nbsp; The passages
must speak for themselves; they are children sent into the
world&mdash;helpless infants like those Pickwickian
&ldquo;expletives, let loose upon society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among
these unexplained things were &ldquo;my Prooshan Blue&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Old Nobs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Walter, with real Pickwickian
sagacity, points to a true explanation which may be applied in
other cases.&nbsp; &ldquo;Probably it was a phrase <i>which he
had heard in a crowd</i>, and had never asked himself what it
meant,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, it seemed appropriate, and what a
person in such a case would use.&nbsp; This is in fact part of
that &ldquo;hallucination&rdquo; of which G. H. Lewes spoke; the
scene came so completely before Boz that the words and phrases
suggested themselves to him and could not be denied, and he did
not ask them to give any account.&nbsp; This principle, however,
does not hinder an amusing display of speculation.&nbsp; Mr.
Andrew Lang&rsquo;s explanation of &ldquo;My Prooshan Blue&rdquo;
is certainly far fetched.&nbsp; He thinks it refers to a dreamy
notion of George IV., who, at one moment, thought of changing the
British uniform to the Prussian Blue.&nbsp; Now, this was not
known at the time, and came out <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>years
later.&nbsp; It had certainly not reached persons of the Weller
class.&nbsp; The truth is that most of Sam&rsquo;s grotesque
epithets, <i>e.g.</i>, &ldquo;young Brokiley sprout,&rdquo; were
the arbitrary coinage of a fantastic mind.&nbsp; This, too, as
Sir Walter said, &ldquo;he may have heard in a crowd,&rdquo; or
in the mazes of his own brain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Nobs&rdquo; is
just as reasonable as Hamlet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old
Truepenny.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you there, Old
Truepenny,&rdquo; might have been said by Sam to his father, as
Hamlet addressed it to <i>his</i>.</p>

89</span>CHAPTER XIII.&nbsp; PICKWICK IN REAL LIFE</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;Dowler and John Forster</h3>
<p>The truculent Dowler figured before in &ldquo;The Tuggs at
Ramsgate&rdquo;&mdash;a very amusing and Pickwickian
tale&mdash;under the title of Capt. Waters, who exhibits the same
simulated ferocity and jealousy of his spouse.&nbsp;
Cruickshank&rsquo;s sketch, too, of the Captain is like that of
Dowler when throwing up the window in the Crescent.&nbsp; Mrs.
Waters is made as attractive as Mrs. Dowler, and Cymon Tuggs,
like Winkle, excites the jealousy of the husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him,&rdquo; roared Dowler, &ldquo;hold
him&mdash;keep him tight&mdash;shut him in till I come
down&mdash;I&rsquo;ll cut his throat&mdash;give me a
knife&mdash;from ear to ear, Mrs. Craddock, I will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Captain Waters: &ldquo;Ah! what do I see?&nbsp; Slaughter,
your sabre&mdash;unhand me&mdash;the villain&rsquo;s
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same story we have an anticipation of another incident:
the shutting up and detection of Pipkin in the cupboard, who is
discovered by a pipe being required, just as young Tuggs was by
his coughing from the tobacco smoke.&nbsp; Boz was partial to
this method of discovery, for, at the close, Snodgrass was thus
concealed and shut up at Osborne&rsquo;s Hotel.&nbsp; His
detection, through the stupidity of the Fat Boy, is singularly
natural and original.</p>
<p>Some of Dowler&rsquo;s dictatorial ways may have been
suggested by Boz&rsquo;s friend, the redoubtable John
Forster.&nbsp; There is one passage in the Bath chapters where we
almost seem to hear our old friend speaking, when he took command
of his friends and introduced them, &ldquo;My friend, Angelo
Cyrus Bantam, Esquire, know each other.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bantam; Mr. Pickwick and his friends are strangers.&nbsp;
<i>They must put their names down</i>.&nbsp; <i>Where&rsquo;s the
book</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then adds: &ldquo;This is a long
call.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time to go; I shall be here again in an
hour.&nbsp; <i>Come</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at the assembly he
still continued his patronage and direction of everybody.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Step in the tea-room&mdash;take your
sixpenn&rsquo;orth.&nbsp; They lay on hot water and call it
tea.&nbsp; Drink it,&rdquo; said Mr. Dowler, <i>in a loud <!--
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>voice</i>, <i>directing Mr. Pickwick</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Forster &ldquo;all over.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have heard him
&ldquo;direct&rdquo; on many an occasion.&nbsp; When starting
from the White Horse Cellars, Dowler, fancying that more
passengers were to be squeezed into the coach, said he would be
d---d if there were; he&rsquo;d bring an action against the
company, and take a post chaise.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;Thackeray</h3>
<p>In Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Newcomes,&rdquo; the writer had
some reminiscences of a place like Eatanswill, for we are told of
the rival newspapers, &ldquo;The Newcome Independent&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Newcome Sentinel,&rdquo; the former being edited by
one Potts.&nbsp; These journals assailed each other like their
brethren in &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there any man
in Newcome except, perhaps, our <i>twaddling old
contemporary</i>, <i>the Sentinel</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp;
Doyle&rsquo;s picture of the election is surely a reminiscence of
Phiz&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There is the same fight between the
bandsmen&mdash;the drum which someone is kicking a hole in, the
brass instrument used, placards, flags, and general
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>.</p>
<p>Doyle could sketch Forster admirably.&nbsp; Witness the
drawing of the travelling party in a carriage, given by Mr.
Kitton in his wonderful collection, &ldquo;Dickens, by pen and
pencil,&rdquo; where he has caught Forster&rsquo;s
&ldquo;magisterial&rdquo; air to the life.&nbsp; The picture,
&ldquo;F. B.,&rdquo; Fred Bayham in the story, is certainly the
figure of Forster (vol. ii., pp. 55 and 116.)&nbsp; F. B. is
shown both as a critic and pressman, though he has nothing of J.
F.&rsquo;s domineering ways.&nbsp; Again, the waiter, speaking of
Lord Highgate, said he was a <i>most harbitrary gent</i>.&nbsp;
This refers to the memorable story of Forster being summoned by
the cabman who said he did so because &ldquo;he were such a
harbitrary cove.&rdquo;&nbsp; The truth was, Forster knew the
distance to a yard, and would tender the cabman his exact fare
and no more.&nbsp; Once, dining with Forster at a hotel in the
country where he had rooms, we lit our cigars after dinner, on
which the waiter remonstrated, saying it was not allowed.&nbsp;
Then I knew the meaning of a &ldquo;Harbitrary Cove.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How the irate Forster blew him up, roared at him, and drove him
out, terrified!&nbsp; It was, indeed, Dowler threatening the
coach proprietor.</p>
<p><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>Thackeray would of course have known the story; he meant
a sort of veiled allusion which had or had not a reference.&nbsp;
We have the key to this sort of thing in the strange,
uncomplimentary reference to Catherine Hayes, the murderess, but
which was at once applied to an interesting and celebrated Irish
singer of the same name.&nbsp; The author must have anticipated
this, and, perhaps, chuckled over the public ignorance, but the
allusion was far-fetched.&nbsp; In the same fashion a dramatist
once chose to dub one of his characters by my own rather unusual
name, on which he protested that he never dreamt of it, that
others bore it; still he, however, was obliged to remove it.</p>
<p>Again, on p. 55 we have this passage: &ldquo;I was thirsty,
having walked from &ldquo;Jack Straw&rsquo;s Castle,&rdquo; at
Hampstead, where poor Kiteley and I had been taking a
chop.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was written in 1855, only a few years
after Forster&rsquo;s admirable performance of Kiteley with the
other amateurs in &ldquo;Every man in his humour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jack Straw&rsquo;s Castle,&rdquo; too, was a regular haunt
of Forster and Dickens.&nbsp; It is as certain as anything can be
that this allusion was not an accidental one.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Tupman</h3>
<p>Tupman&rsquo;s relations to Mr. Pickwick were somewhat
peculiar; he was elderly&mdash;about Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
age&mdash;whereas Winkle and Snodgrass were young fellows under
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s guardianship.&nbsp; Over them he could
exercise despotic authority; which he did, and secured
obedience.&nbsp; It was difficult to do this in the case of his
contemporary, Tupman, who naturally resented being &ldquo;sat
upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the incident of the <i>F&ecirc;te</i> at
Mrs. Leo Hunter&rsquo;s, and the Brigand&rsquo;s
dress&mdash;&ldquo;the two-inch tail,&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick was
rather insulting and injudicious, gibing at and ridiculing his
friend on the exhibition of his corpulence, so that Tupman, stung
to fury, was about to assault him.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick had to
apologise, but it is clear the insult rankled; and it would
appear that Tupman was never afterwards much in the confidence of
his leader, and, for that matter, in the confidence of his
author.&nbsp; Boz, either consciously or unconsciously, felt
this.&nbsp; Tupman, too, never seems to have got over the figure
he &ldquo;cut&rdquo; in the spinster aunt business, and the loss
of general respect.</p>
<p>Still he submitted to be taken about under Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>patronage, but soon the mutual
irritation broke out.&nbsp; The occasion was the latter&rsquo;s
putting on speckled stockings for the dance at Manor Farm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>You</i> in silk stockings,&rdquo; exclaimed Tupman,
jocosely; a most natural, harmless remark, considering that Mr.
Pickwick invariably wore his gaiters at evening parties.&nbsp;
But the remark was hotly resented, and challenged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see nothing extraordinary in the stockings <i>as</i>
stockings, I trust, sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course his friend said
&ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo; which was the truth, but Mr.
Pickwick put aside the obvious meaning.&nbsp; Mr. Tupman
&ldquo;walked away,&rdquo; wishing to avoid another altercation,
afraid to trust himself; and Mr. Pickwick, proud of having once
more &ldquo;put him down,&rdquo; assumed his &ldquo;customary
benign expression.&rdquo;&nbsp; This did not promise well.</p>
<p>In all the Manor Farm jollity, we hear little or nothing of
Tupman, who seems to have been thought a cypher.&nbsp; No doubt
he felt that the girls could never look at him without a
smile&mdash;thinking of the spinster aunt.&nbsp; In the picture
of the scene, we find this &ldquo;old Buck&rdquo; in the
foreground, on one knee, trying to pickup a pocket handkerchief
and holding a young lady by the hand.&nbsp; Snodgrass and his
lady are behind; Winkle and his Arabella on the other side;
Trundle and his lady at the fire.&nbsp; Then who was
Tupman&rsquo;s young woman?&nbsp; She is not mentioned in the
text, yet is evidently a prominent personage&mdash;one of the
family.&nbsp; At Ipswich, he was crammed into the sedan chair
with his leader&mdash;two very stout gentlemen&mdash;which could
not have increased their good humour, though Tupman assisted him
from within to stand up and address the mob.&nbsp; We are told
that &ldquo;all Mr. Tupman&rsquo;s entreaties to have the lid of
the vehicle closed&rdquo; were unattended to.&nbsp; He felt the
ridicule of his position&mdash;a sedan chair carried along, and a
stout man speaking.&nbsp; This must have produced friction.&nbsp;
Then there was the sense of injustice in being charged with
aiding and abetting his leader, which Mr. Pickwick did not
attempt to clear him from.&nbsp; When Mr. Pickwick fell through
the ice, Tupman, instead of rendering help, ran off to Manor Farm
with the news of the accident.</p>
<p>Then the whole party went down to Bath and, during their stay
there, we have not a word of Tupman.&nbsp; He came to see his
friend in the <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Fleet&mdash;with the others of
course.&nbsp; But now for the remarkable thing.&nbsp; On Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s happy release and when every one was rejoining,
Wardle invited the whole party to a family dinner at the
Osborne.&nbsp; There were Snodgrass, Winkle, Perker even, but no
Tupman!&nbsp; Winkle and his wife were at the &ldquo;George and
Vulture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why not send to Tupman as well.&nbsp; No
one perhaps thought of him&mdash;he had taken no interest in the
late exciting adventures, had not been of the least help to
anybody&mdash;a selfish old bachelor.&nbsp; When Mr. Pickwick had
absented himself looking for his Dulwich house, it is pointed out
with marked emphasis that certain folk&mdash;&ldquo;among whom
was Mr. Tupman&rdquo;&mdash;maliciously suggested that he was
busy looking for a wife!&nbsp; Neither Winkle nor Snodgrass
started this hypothesis, but Tupman.&nbsp; He, however, was at
Dulwich for Winkle&rsquo;s marriage, and had a seat on the
Pickwick coach.&nbsp; In later days, we learn that the
Snodgrasses settled themselves at Dingley Dell so as to be near
the family&mdash;the Winkles, at Dulwich, to be near Mr.
Pickwick, both showing natural affection.&nbsp; The selfish
Tupman, thinking of nobody but himself, settled at Richmond where
he showed himself on the Terrace with a youthful and jaunty air,
&ldquo;trying to attract the elderly single ladies of
condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the others kept in contact with their
chief, asking him to be godfather, &amp;c.&nbsp; But we have not
a word of Tupman.&nbsp; It is likely, with natures such as his,
that he never forgot the insulting remark about his
corpulence.&nbsp; That is the way with such vain creatures.</p>
<p>Boz, I believe, had none of these speculations positively
before him, but he was led by the logic of his story.&nbsp; He
had to follow his characters and their development; they did not
follow him.</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;Grummer</h3>
<p>This well drawn sketch of an ignorant, self-sufficient
constable is admirable.&nbsp; I have little doubt that one of the
incidents in which he figures was suggested to <i>Boz</i> by a
little adventure of Grimaldi&rsquo;s which he found in the mass
of papers submitted to him, and which he worked up
effectively.&nbsp; A stupid and malicious old constable, known as
&ldquo;Old Lucas,&rdquo; went to arrest the clown on an imaginary
charge, <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>as he was among his friends at the
theatre.&nbsp; As in the case of Grummer, the friends, like
Winkle and Snodgrass, threatened the constable.&nbsp; The
magistrate heard the case, sentenced Grimaldi to pay 5s.
fine.&nbsp; Old Lucas, in his disappointment, arrested him
again.&nbsp; Being attacked by Grimaldi, as Grummer was by Sam,
he drew his staff and behaved outrageously.&nbsp; The magistrate
then, like Nupkins, had him placed in the dock, and
sentenced.</p>
<p>It has also been stated that Grummer was drawn from
Towshend&mdash;the celebrated Bow Street Runner again introduced
in &ldquo;Oliver Twist.&rdquo;&nbsp; Towshend was a privileged
person, like Grummer, and gave his advice familiarly to the
magistrates.</p>

95</span>CHAPTER XIV.&nbsp; CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;The Wardle Family</h3>
<p>Here is a very pleasing and natural group of persons, in whom
it is impossible not to take a deep interest.&nbsp; They are like
some amiable family that we have known.&nbsp; Old Wardle, as he
is called, though he was under fifty, was a widower, and had
remained so, quite content with his daughters&rsquo;
attachment.&nbsp; He had his worthy old mother to live with him,
to whom he was most dutiful, tolerant, and affectionate.&nbsp;
These two points recommend him.&nbsp; There was no better son
than Boz himself, so he could appreciate these things.&nbsp; The
sketch is interesting as a picture of the patriarchal system that
obtained in the country districts, all the family forming one
household, as in France.&nbsp; For here we have Wardle, his
mother, and his sister, together with his two pleasing daughters,
while, later on, his sons-in-law established themselves close
by.&nbsp; The &ldquo;poor relations&rdquo; seem to have been
always there.&nbsp; It is astonishing how Boz, in his short
career, could have observed and noticed these things.&nbsp;
Wardle&rsquo;s fondness for his daughters is really charming, and
displayed without affectation.&nbsp; He connected them with the
image of his lost wife.&nbsp; There is no more natural, truly
affecting passage than his display of fretfulness when he got
some inkling that his second daughter was about to make a rather
improvident marriage with young Snodgrass.&nbsp; The first had
followed her inclinations in wedding Trundle&mdash;a not very
good match&mdash;but he did not lose her as the pair lived beside
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>him.&nbsp; He thought Emily, however, a pretty girl who
ought to do better, and he had his eye on &ldquo;a young
gentleman in the neighbourhood&rdquo;&mdash;and for some four or
five months past he had been pressing her to receive his
addresses favourably.&nbsp; This was clearly a good match.&nbsp;
Not that he would unduly press her, but &ldquo;if she
<i>could</i>, for I would never force a young girl&rsquo;s
inclinations.&rdquo;&nbsp; He never thought, he says, that the
Snodgrass business was serious.&nbsp; But, how natural that, when
Arabella, their friend, had become a regular heroine and had gone
off with her Winkle, that this should fill Emily&rsquo;s head
with similar thoughts, and set the pair on thinking that they
were persecuted, &amp;c.&nbsp; What a natural scene is this
between father and daughter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My daughter Bella, Emily having gone to bed
with a headache after she had read Arabella&rsquo;s letter to me,
sat herself down by my side the other evening, and began to talk
over this marriage affair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, pa,&rdquo; she
says; &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, my
dear,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all very well; I
hope it&rsquo;s for the best.&rdquo;&nbsp; I answered in this way
because I was sitting before the fire at the time, drinking my
grog rather thoughtfully, and I knew my throwing in an undecided
word now and then would induce her to continue talking.&nbsp;
Both my girls are pictures of their dear mother, and as I grow
old I like to sit with only them by me; for their voices and
looks carry me back to the happiest period of my life, and make
me, for the moment, as young as I used to be then, though not
quite so light-hearted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a marriage
of affection, pa,&rdquo; said Bella, after a short silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but such marriages do
not always turn out the happiest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry
to hear you express your opinion against marriages of affection,
pa,&rdquo; said Bella, colouring a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
wrong; I ought not to have said so, my dear, either,&rdquo; said
I patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could
do it, &ldquo;for your mother&rsquo;s was one and so was
yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, I meant,
pa,&rdquo; said Bella.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fact is, pa, I wanted to
speak to you about Emily.&rdquo;&nbsp; The long and the short of
it is, then, that Bella at last mustered up courage to tell me
that Emily was unhappy; that she and your young friend Snodgrass
had been in constant correspondence and communication ever since
last Christmas; that she had very dutifully made up her mind to
run away with him, in laudable imitation of her old friend and
schoolfellow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another member of this pleasant household was &ldquo;The Fat
Boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is nothing humorous or farcical in the
mere physical exhibition of a fat person, <i>qu&acirc;</i> his
fat.&nbsp; It was, indeed, the fashion of the day&mdash;and on
the stage particularly&mdash;to assume that fatness was
associated with something comic.&nbsp; There are a number of
stout persons in Pickwick&mdash;the hero himself, Tupman, old
Weller, and all the coachmen, the turnkeys, Slammer, Wardle, Fat
Boy, Nupkin&rsquo;s <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>cook, Grummer, Buzfuz, Mrs. Weller,
Mr. Bagman&rsquo;s uncle, and others.&nbsp; Thackeray attempted
to work with this element in the case of Jos Sedley, and his
fatness had a very close connection with his character.&nbsp;
But, in the case of Boz, his aim was much more intellectual and,
as it were, refined.&nbsp; For his object was to show what was a
fat person&rsquo;s view of this world, as seen through the medium
of Fat.&nbsp; The Fat Boy is not a selfish, sensual being by
nature&mdash;he is really helpless, and the creature of necessity
who is forced by his bulk to take a certain <i>fat</i> view of
everything round him.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we reflect on it we shall
see how clearly this is carried out.&nbsp; It is curious that, in
the instance of the Fat Boy, Boz should have repeated or
duplicated a situation, and yet contrived to impart such varied
treatment, but I suspect no one has ever noticed the point.&nbsp;
Joe, it will be remembered, witnessed the proceedings in the
arbour, when Mr. Tupman declared his passion for the spinster
aunt, and the subsequent embracing&mdash;to the great
embarrassment of the pair.&nbsp; At the close of the story he
also intruded on another happy pair&mdash;Mr. Snodgrass and his
<i>inamorata</i>&mdash;at a similar delicate moment.&nbsp; Yet in
the treatment, how different&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I wants to make yer
flesh creep</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;his taking the old lady into
confidence; and then he was pronounced by his master, Wardle, to
be under some delusion&mdash;&ldquo;let me at
him&rdquo;&mdash;&amp;c., so his story and report led him into a
scrape.&nbsp; When he intruded on the pair at Osborne&rsquo;s
Hotel, and Snodgrass was, later, shut up there, again he was made
the scapegoat, and Wardle insisted that he was drunk,
&amp;c.&nbsp; So here were the incidents repeating
themselves.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;Shooting, Riding, Driving, etc.</h3>
<p>Boz declared in one of his Prefaces that he was so ignorant of
country sports, that he could not attempt to deal with them in a
story.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this protest, he has given us a
couple of shooting scenes which show much experience of that form
of field sports.&nbsp; There is a tone of sympathy and freshness,
a keen enjoyment of going forth in the morning, which proves that
he himself had taken part in such things.&nbsp; Rook-shooting was
then an enjoyable sport, and Boz was probably thinking of the
rooks at Cobham, where he had no <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>doubt hovered
round the party when a lad.&nbsp; As we know, Mr. Tupman, who was
a mere looker-on, was &ldquo;peppered&rdquo; by his friend
Winkle, a difficult thing to understand, as Winkle must have been
firing high into the trees, and if he hit his friend at all,
would have done so with much more severity.&nbsp; The persons who
were in serious danger from Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s gun were the boys
in the trees, and we may wonder that one, at least, was not shot
dead.&nbsp; But the whole is so pleasantly described as to give
one a perfect <i>envie</i> to go out and shoot rooks.&nbsp; There
are some delightful touches, such as Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s alarm
about the climbing boys, &ldquo;for he was not quite certain that
the distress in the agricultural interest, might not have
compelled the small boys attached to the soil to earn a
precarious and hazardous existence by making marks of themselves
for inexperienced sportsmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;the
boy shouted and shook a branch with a nest on it.&nbsp;
<i>Half-a-dozen young rooks in violent conversation flew out to
ask what the matter was</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Does not this bring the
whole scene before us.</p>
<p>The other shooting scene is near Bury St. Edmunds&mdash;on Sir
Geoffrey Manning&rsquo;s grounds&mdash;on September 1st, 1830, or
1827, whichever Boz pleases, when &ldquo;many a young partridge
who strutted complacently among the stubble with all his finical
coxcombry of youth, and many an older one who watched his levity
out of his little, round eye with the contemptuous air of a bird
of wisdom and experience, alike unconscious of their approaching
doom, basked in the fresh morning air with lively and blithesome
feelings, and, a few hours later, were laid low upon the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we have the beginning of that delightful
fashion of Dickens&rsquo;s, which he later carried to such
perfection, of associating human feelings and associations with
the animal creation, and also inanimate objects.</p>
<p>Everything connected with &ldquo;the shooting&rdquo; is
admirably touched: The old, experienced &ldquo;shot,&rdquo;
Wardle; the keepers and their boys; the dogs; the sham amateurs;
the carrying of the guns &ldquo;reversed arms, like privates at a
funeral.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Winkle &ldquo;flashed and blazed and
smoked away without producing any material results; at one time
expending his charge in mid-air, and at others sending it
skimming along so near the surface of the ground as to place the
lives of the <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>two dogs on a rather uncertain and
precarious tenure.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the
dogs&rsquo; legs?&nbsp; How <i>queer</i> they&rsquo;re
standing!&rsquo; whispered Mr. Winkle.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hush,
can&rsquo;t you!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see they are making a
point?&rsquo; said Wardle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Making a point?&rsquo;
said Mr. Winkle, glaring about him, as if he expected to discern
some particular beauty in the landscape which the sagacious
animals were calling special attention to.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are
they pointing at?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep your eyes open,&rsquo;
said Wardle, not heeding the question in the excitement of the
moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now then.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; How natural
and humorous is all this.</p>
<p>This was partridge shooting, &ldquo;old
style&rdquo;&mdash;delightful and inspiriting, as all have felt
who have shared in it.&nbsp; Now we have &ldquo;drives&rdquo; on
a vast scale; then you would follow the birds from field to field
&ldquo;marking them down.&rdquo;&nbsp; I myself with an urchin, a
dog, and a single-barrelled old gun have thus followed a few
precious birds from field to field all the day and secured them
at the last.&nbsp; That was true enjoyment.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Horses and Driving in &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>For one who so modestly disclaimed all knowledge of sporting
and country tastes, Boz shows a very familiar acquaintance with
horses and their ways.&nbsp; He has introduced a number of these
animals whose points are all distinctly emphasized: a number of
persons are shown to be interested in horses, who exhibit their
knowledge of and sympathise with the animals, a knowledge and
sympathy which is but a reflection of his own.&nbsp; The cunning
hand that could so discriminate between shades of humorous
characters would not be at a loss to analyse traits of equine
nature.&nbsp; There is the cab horse, said to be forty years old
and kept in the shafts for two or three weeks at a time, which is
depicted in Seymour&rsquo;s plate.&nbsp; How excellently drawn
are the two Rochester steeds: one &ldquo;an immense brown horse,
displaying great symmetry of bone,&rdquo; which was to be driven
by Mr. Pickwick, and Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s riding animal, another
immense horse &ldquo;apparently a near relative of the animal in
the chaise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t shy, does
he?&rdquo;&nbsp; The ostler guaranteed him quiet&mdash;&ldquo;a
hinfant in arms might drive him&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He
wouldn&rsquo;t shy if he met a whole waggon-load of monkeys with
<!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>their tails burnt off.&rdquo;&nbsp; A far more original
illustration than anything used by the Wellers, whose special
form that was.&nbsp; I pass over the details of the driving and
the riding which show a perfect knowledge of animals, such as
&ldquo;the tall quadruped.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing is more droll
than the description of the loathing with which the party came to
regard the animal they were compelled to lead about all
day.&nbsp; Then we have the post horses and all connected with
them.&nbsp; There is Tom Smart&rsquo;s &ldquo;vixenish
mare,&rdquo; quite an intelligent character in her way.&nbsp; The
account of the coach drive down to Muggleton shows admirable
observation of the ways of the drivers.</p>
<p>Ben Allen&rsquo;s aunt had her private fly, painted a sad
green colour drawn by a &ldquo;chubby sort of brown
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; I pass over the ghostly mailcoach horses that
flew through the night in &ldquo;The Story of the Bagman&rsquo;s
Uncle,&rdquo; flowing-maned, black horses.&nbsp; There are many
post horses figuring in Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s journey from Bristol
to Birmingham and thence home; horses in the rain and out of
it.</p>
<p>Namby&rsquo;s horse was &ldquo;a bay, a well-looking animal
enough, but with something of a flash and dog-fighting air about
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The horses which took the hackney coach to the
Fleet jolted along as hackney coaches usually do.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The horses &lsquo;went better,&rsquo; the driver said,
&lsquo;when they had anything before them.&rsquo;&nbsp; They must
have gone at a most extraordinary pace when there was
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Visiting the Fleet with Mrs. Weller and the
deputy Shepherd, Mr. Weller drove up from Dorking with the old
piebald in his chaise cart, which, after long delay, was brought
out for the return journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he stands at livery
much longer he&rsquo;ll stand at nothin&rsquo; as we go
back.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a capital scene at the opening of
Chapter XLVI., when the &ldquo;cabrioilet&rdquo; was drawing up
at Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s, and where so much that is dramatic is
&ldquo;got out&rdquo; of such a simple incident between the
contending directions.</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;Mr. Pickwick in Silk Stockings.</h3>
<p>How well Boz knew how to touch the chords of human
character&mdash;a power that certainly needs long experience to
work&mdash;is shown by the scene at Wardle&rsquo;s dance, where
Mr. Pickwick is nettled by Tupman&rsquo;s <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>remarking
that he was wearing &ldquo;pumps&rdquo; for the first time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>You</i> in silk stockings,&rdquo; said that
gentleman.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick had just called attention to the
change which he considered a sort of public event to be admired
by all.&nbsp; &ldquo;See this great man condescending to our
frivolous tastes,&rdquo; and his host had noted it in a
flattering way.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean to dance?&rdquo;&nbsp; But
Tupman did not look at it in this respectful way&mdash;he made a
joke of it!&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> in silk
stockings.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was insolent to the grave, great man
and philosopher, so he turned sharply on his familiar: &ldquo;And
why not, sir&mdash;why not?&rdquo;&nbsp; This with warmth.&nbsp;
The foolish Tupman, still inclined to be jocose, said, &ldquo;Oh,
of course, there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t wear
them&rdquo;&mdash;a most awkward speech&mdash;as who should say,
&ldquo;This is a free country&mdash;a man can wear a night cap in
public if he chooses.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I imagine not,
sir&mdash;I imagine not,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, in a <i>very
peremptory</i> tone.&nbsp; Mr. Tupman had contemplated a laugh,
but he found it was a serious matter, so he looked grave, and
said <i>they were a pretty pattern</i>.&nbsp; How natural is all
this!&nbsp; And still more so his leader&rsquo;s reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope they are,&rdquo; he said, fixing his eyes upon his
friend, &ldquo;You see nothing extraordinary in the stockings,
<i>as</i> stockings, I trust, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; The frightened
Tupman said, &ldquo;Certainly not, Oh, certainly not,&rdquo; and
walked away.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s face resumed its
customary benign expression.&nbsp; This little picture of
weakness in an eminent man is characteristic.&nbsp; For observe,
when Tupman showed the folly of wearing a &ldquo;two inch
tail&rdquo; to the brigand&rsquo;s coat, Mr. Pickwick was
furious, told him he was too old and too fat; but when someone
remarks on <i>his</i> silk stockings he gets deeply
offended.&nbsp; His vanity is touched, there should have been no
remark, or, at least, only of admiration.&nbsp; He was, in fact,
one of those flattered and spoiled personages who cannot see any
harm in their doing what they reprove in others.&nbsp; Many a
really great character is weak in this direction.&nbsp; Observe
the disingenuousness of the great man; he knew, perfectly, that
Tupman noticed nothing odd in the stockings, &ldquo;<i>as</i>
stockings,&rdquo; he meant the oddity of his wearing them at all,
and he had said so, plainly.&nbsp; But, ignoring this, the great
man chose to assume that he was insolently reflecting on their
pattern as outlandish.&nbsp; With his despotic pressure, he
forced him to say they were of a &ldquo;pretty pattern,&rdquo;
and thus vindicated his authority.</p>
<h3><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>V.&mdash;Violent Assaults, Shooting,
&amp;c</h3>
<p>Duelling, imprisonment for debt, intoxication, elopements,
are, perhaps, the most striking social incidents in
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; that have disappeared and become all but
antiquarian in their character.&nbsp; Yet another, almost as
curious, was the ready recourse to physical force or
violence&mdash;fistic correction as it might be termed.&nbsp; A
gentleman of quiet, restrained habit, like Mr. Pickwick, was
prepared, in case of call, either to threaten or execute summary
chastisement on anyone who offended him.&nbsp; The police or
magistrates seemed not to have been thought of, for the victim
would not think of appealing to either&mdash;all which seems
strange to us nowadays.&nbsp; At the Review even, the soldiers
coolly overthrew Mr. Pickwick and his friends who had got in
their way.&nbsp; Winkle was maltreated so severely that the blood
streamed from his nose; this would not now be tolerated.&nbsp;
When Jingle affronted the great man by calling his friend
&ldquo;Tuppy,&rdquo; Mr. Pickwick, we are told, &ldquo;hurled the
inkstand madly forward and followed it up himself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This hurling of things at offenders was a common incident,
particularly in quarrels at table, when the decanter was
frequently so used, or a glass of wine thrown in the face.&nbsp;
After the adventure at the Boarding School, Mr. Pickwick
&ldquo;indented his pillow with a tremendous blow,&rdquo; and
announced that, if he met Jingle again, he would &ldquo;inflict
personal chastisement on him&rdquo;; while Sam declared that he
would bring &ldquo;real water&rdquo; into Job&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
Old Lobbs, in the story, was going to throttle Pipkin.&nbsp; Mrs.
Potts insisted that the editor of <i>The Independent</i> should
be horsewhipped.&nbsp; More extraordinary still, old Weller, at a
quiet tea-meeting, assaulted the Shepherd, giving him &ldquo;two
or three for himself, and two or three more to hand over to the
man with the red nose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everyone set themselves right
in this way and, it is clear, knew how to use their &ldquo;bunch
of fives.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor were there any summonses or police
courts afterwards; the incident was closed.&nbsp; Sam, attempting
to rescue his master at Ipswich, knocked down the
&ldquo;specials&rdquo; right and left, knocking down some for
others to lie upon, yet he was only fined two pounds for the
first assault and three for the second&mdash;now he would have
been sent to jail under a severe sentence.&nbsp; Mrs. Raddle
insisted that her husband should get up and knock every <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>one of the guests down stairs, while Jack Hopkins
offered to go upstairs and &ldquo;pitch into the
landlord.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the Brick Lane meeting, Brother
Stiggins, intoxicated, knocked Brother Tadger down the stairs,
while old Weller violently assaulted Stiggins.&nbsp; At Bath,
Dowler hunted Winkle round the Crescent, threatening to cut his
throat; and at Bristol, when the terrified Winkle tried to ring
the bell, Dowler fancied that he was going to strike him.&nbsp;
At Bristol, Ben Allen flourished the poker, threatening his
sister&rsquo;s rival, and when Mr. Pickwick sent Sam to capture
Winkle, he instructed him to knock him down even, if he resisted;
this direction was given with all seriousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he
attempts to run away from you, <i>knock him down</i>, or lock him
up, you have my full authority, Sam.&rdquo;&nbsp; The despotism
of this amiable man was truly extraordinary, he ruled his
&ldquo;followers&rdquo; with a rod of iron.&nbsp; That such
should be exercised, or accepted even by the reader, is a note of
the time.&nbsp; It was, however, only a logical consequence of
the other summary methods.</p>
<p>The altercation between Mr. Pickwick and his other
&ldquo;follower,&rdquo; Tupman, arising out of the
&ldquo;two-inch tail&rdquo; question, was on the same
lines.&nbsp; For the affront of being called fat and old the
latter scientifically turned up his cuffs and announced that he
would inflict summary chastisement on his leader.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick met him with a cordial &ldquo;come on,&rdquo; throwing
himself into a pugilistic attitude, supposed by the two
bystanders to have been intended as a posture of defence.&nbsp;
This seems to have been accepted as a natural incident, though it
was deprecated.&nbsp; In the Fleet Prison, when Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s nightcap was snatched off, he retorted with a
smart blow, and again invited everyone, &ldquo;all of you,&rdquo;
to &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the coachmen attended Sam to
the Fleet, walking eight abreast, they had to leave behind one of
the party &ldquo;to fight a ticket porter, it being arranged that
his friends should call for him as they came back.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Even in a moment of agitation&mdash;as when Ben Allen learned
that his sister had &ldquo;bolted,&rdquo; his impulse was to rush
at Martin the groom and throttle him; the latter, in return,
&ldquo;felling the medical student to the ground.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then we have the extraordinary and realistic combat between Pott
and Slurk in the kitchen of the &ldquo;Saracen&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; Towcester&mdash;the one armed with a shovel, the
other with a carpet bag&mdash;and old Weller&rsquo;s chastisement
<!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>of Stiggins.&nbsp; In short, this system of
chastisement on the spot, it is clear, was a necessary equipment,
and everybody, high and low, was understood to be ready to secure
satisfaction for himself by the aid of violence.&nbsp; No doubt
this was a consequence of the duel which was, of course, to be
had recourse to only as the last resort.</p>
<p>When the wretched Jingle, and the still more wretched Job met
Mr. Pickwick in the Fleet, and the latter, giving money, had
said, &ldquo;Take that, sir,&rdquo; the author adds, &ldquo;Take
what? . . .&nbsp; As the world runs, it ought to have been a
sound, hearty cuff, for Mr. Pickwick had been duped, deceived,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, Boz thought, as of course, that this
was the suitable method of treatment in such cases.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Must we tell the truth?&rdquo; he goes on; &ldquo;it was a
piece of money.&rdquo;&nbsp; The unconsciousness of all this is
very striking.</p>
<h3>VI.&mdash;Winkle and Snodgrass</h3>
<p>It has always seemed a matter of astonishment to me how such a
creature as Winkle should have won the fair Arabella.&nbsp; Every
act of this man was a deception&mdash;he could not help pretence,
or, shall we say it boldly, lying.&nbsp; His duel was a series of
tricks&mdash;his shooting, skating, etc., all a sham.&nbsp; Even
when found out as an impostor before all the keepers and others,
we find him impudently saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
shall do <i>to get up my shooting again</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
fellow never had any shooting to get up.&nbsp; But the mere habit
of untruth was ingrained in the man.&nbsp; His undignified race,
in a dressing-gown, round the Crescent was no doubt concealed
from Arabella&mdash;she would never have got over that!&nbsp; As
a display of cowardice it was only matched by his hypocritical
assumption of courage before Dowler when he found he could assume
it safely.&nbsp; He deceived his father and Mr. Pickwick as to
his marriage, and dropped on his knees to the latter to beg
pardon.&nbsp; How mean, too, was his behaviour to Mrs. Pott in
the difficulty with her husband.&nbsp; But nothing could shake
the interest of the fair Arabella in her lover, even his
ignominious and public treatment by Mr. Pickwick at the skating
exhibition.&nbsp; How <i>can</i> we account for it.&nbsp; But Boz
knew the female nature well, and here is the explanation: Winkle
had been &ldquo;out&rdquo;&mdash;had figured in a duel with a
real officer <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>in the army.&nbsp; There was no
mistake about <i>that</i>&mdash;gone out, too, in what appeared a
chivalrous manner to save the honour of the club.&nbsp; At least
it had the appearance of all that (though here was another
falsehood).&nbsp; This had been told to all&mdash;no doubt by
Winkle himself&mdash;many times over.&nbsp; Nothing could
enfeeble that, it seemed heroic, and covered all other
<i>laches</i>.&nbsp; Neither did it lose in <i>his</i> telling of
it.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous feature surely in the man was his
costume&mdash;meant to be of a sporting complexion&mdash;which he
never abandoned: green shooting coat, plaid neckchief, and
closely fitting drabs.&nbsp; When he returned from his honeymoon,
he was still in this uniform.</p>
<p>We may assume, however, that this points to a custom of the
time: that the sportsman was <i>always</i> a sportsman.&nbsp;
Even at the club meeting, at a poorish room in a tavern, he must
carry on the fiction that he has just come back from a
day&rsquo;s sporting, for there on the floor, conspicuous, are
the fowling piece, game bag, fishing rod, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Snodgrass was another incapable and quite
uninteresting&mdash;a person whom we would not care to
know.&nbsp; He posed as a poet and, to this end, wore, even at
the club, &ldquo;a mysterious blue cloak, with a canine skin
collar&rdquo;; imagine this of a warm evening&mdash;May
12&mdash;in a stuffy room in Huggin Lane!&nbsp; He must, however,
live up to his character, at all hazards.</p>
<p>Snodgrass and his verses, and his perpetual &ldquo;note
book,&rdquo; must have made him a bore of the first water.&nbsp;
How could the charming Emily have selected him.&nbsp; He, too,
had some of Winkle&rsquo;s craft.&nbsp; He had been entertained
cordially and hospitably by old Wardle, and repaid him by
stealing his daughter&rsquo;s affections in a very underhand way,
actually plotting to run away with her.</p>
<p>There was something rather ignominious in his detection at
Osborne&rsquo;s Hotel.&nbsp; He is a very colourless being.&nbsp;
As to his being a Poet, it would seem to be that he merely gave
himself out for one and persuaded his friends that he was
such.&nbsp; His remarks at the &ldquo;Peacock&rdquo; are truly
sapient: &ldquo;Show me the man that says anything against women,
as women, and <i>I boldly declare he is not a
man</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Which is matched by Mr. Winkle&rsquo;s
answer to the charge of his being &ldquo;a serpent&rdquo;:
&ldquo;Prove it,&rdquo; said Mr. Winkle, warmly.&nbsp; It is to
be suspected that the marriage with the amiable Emily was not a
success.&nbsp; <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>The author throws out a hint to that
effect: &ldquo;Mr Snodgrass, being occasionally abstracted and
melancholy, is to this day reputed a great poet among his
acquaintance, though we do not find he has ever written anything
to encourage the belief.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words he was
carrying on the old Pickwick game of &ldquo;Humbug.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So great an intellect had quite thrown itself away on poor
Emily&mdash;even his abstraction and melancholy.&nbsp; How
natural too that he should &ldquo;hang on&rdquo; to his
father-in-law &ldquo;and establish himself close to Dingly
Dell&rdquo;&mdash;to &ldquo;sponge,&rdquo; probably&mdash;while
he made a sham of farming; for are we not told that he purchased
and cultivated a small farm&mdash;&ldquo;<i>more for occupation
than profit</i>&rdquo;&mdash;thus again making believe.&nbsp;
Poor Emily!</p>
<p>I lately looked through the swollen pages of the monster
London Directory to find how many of the Pickwickian names were
in common use.&nbsp; There was not a single Snodgrass, though
there was one Winkel, and one &ldquo;Winkle and Co.&rdquo; in St.
Mary Axe.&nbsp; There was one Tupman, a Court dressmaker&mdash;no
Nupkins, but some twenty Magnuses, and not a single
Pickwick.&nbsp; There were, however, some twenty-four
Wellers.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 107</span>CHAPTER XV.&mdash;DULWICH</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s Diversions</h3>
<p>Mr. Pickwick, as we know, retired to end his days at peaceful
Dulwich&mdash;placid and tranquil as his own amiable heart.&nbsp;
It is as certain as though we had been living there and had seen
all that was going on, that he became universally popular, and
quite a personage in the place.&nbsp; Everyone was sure to meet
him taking his afternoon walk along the rural lanes, or making
his way to the Greyhound, where he was often found of an
evening&mdash;possibly every evening.&nbsp; This Greyhound, an
old-fashioned and somewhat antique house, though not mentioned in
the story, is linked to it by implication; for to settle at
Dulwich and ignore the Greyhound was a thing that could not
be.&nbsp; There is a Pickwickian tone&mdash;or was, rather, for
it is now levelled&mdash;about the place, and Boz himself used to
frequent it, belonging to a sort of dining club that met down
there.</p>
<p>Such a paper as say the <i>Dulwich Observer</i> would make
much account of a man like Mr. Pickwick; all his movements would
be chronicled, and anyone that chooses to bid Sarah or Mary
&ldquo;bring up the file for the year of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
residence,&rdquo; must find innumerable entries.&nbsp; Let us
supply a few of these imaginative extracts:</p>
<h4>MR. PICKWICK AT THE OPENING OF THE DULWICH LITERARY AND
SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION.</h4>
<blockquote><p>A meeting of this admirable and thriving
society&mdash;which, as our readers know, was founded by Mr.
Pickwick&mdash;was held on Saturday, at the Greyhound Inn, where
this learned and popular gentleman read a special paper on Ralph
Alleyne and his celebrated college at Dulwich.&nbsp; There was a
large attendance.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick stated that he had long been
making researches into the Alleyne pedigree, and had made an
astonishing discovery&mdash;Alleyne, he found, was the family of
the Allens!&nbsp; <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>A very dear and intimate friend of
his own&mdash;a high member of the medical profession&mdash;with
whom he had spent some of the pleasantest hours of his whole
life, and who was now following his practice in India, also bore
the name of Allen&mdash;Benjamin Allen!&nbsp; It will be said
that there was not much in this; there were many Allens about,
and, in the world generally (loud laughter); but what will be
said when, on carelessly turning over the old rate-books, he came
on this startling fact?&nbsp; That at the beginning of the
century his old friend&rsquo;s grandfather actually occupied a
small house on Tulse Hill, not five minutes&rsquo; walk from the
college (loud applause).&nbsp; He saw, they saw the significance
of this.&nbsp; Following up the clue, he next found that this
gentleman was a person of literary tastes&mdash;and, mark this,
often went into town to scientific meetings and to the theatres
(loud applause).&nbsp; Further, he had discovered one or two very
&ldquo;oldest inhabitants&rdquo; (a laugh) who had known this
very Benjamin Allen, the grandfather, and who could not recall
anything precise about him: but all agreed, and they should
further mark this, that he had the air and bearing of a man of
theatrical tastes, and that &ldquo;it was as likely as
not&rdquo;&mdash;to use their very words&mdash;&ldquo;that he
belonged to the family of Ralph Allen&rdquo; (applause).&nbsp;
The learned gentleman then proceeded to work out his clever
theory with much ingenuity, and, at the end, left &ldquo;not a
shadow of a shade of a doubt&rdquo; in the minds of his hearers
in general, and in his own mind in particular, that this Dr.
Benjamin Allen&mdash;of the East Indies&mdash;was the lineal
descendant of our own Ralph Allen.&nbsp; We have, however, with
regret to add, that this evening did not pass over so
harmoniously as it could be desired.&nbsp; As soon as Mr.
Pickwick had sat down and discussion was invited&mdash;Mr.
Pickwick, however, saying that there was really nothing to
discuss, as no one knew the facts but himself&mdash;a visitor
from Town, who had been introduced at his own request by one of
the members, stood up, will it be believed, to <i>attack</i> Mr.
Pickwick and his paper!&nbsp; It transpired that this
intruder&rsquo;s name was Blotton, a person in the haberdashery
line, and that he came from somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Huggin Lane.&nbsp; He said that all they had been listening to
was simple moonshine.&nbsp; (<i>No</i>!&nbsp; <i>No</i>!)&nbsp;
But Yes!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Had they ever heard of a river in
Monmouth and another in Macedon?&nbsp; There was an Allen some
hundred years ago&mdash;and a Ben Allen now alive in India.&nbsp;
What rubbish was this?&nbsp; (&ldquo;<i>Shame</i>&rdquo; cries of
&ldquo;<i>put him out</i>&rdquo;).&nbsp; Where was the
connection, he asked.&nbsp; Some old dotard or dodderer, they
were told, said so.&nbsp; The doddering in the case was not
confined to that individual.&nbsp; Here Mr. Pickwick rose, and,
with much heat, told the intruder to sit down.&nbsp; He would not
hear him; he ought to be ashamed of himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would
you believe it,&rdquo; went on Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;this is a
person who was actually <i>expelled</i>&mdash;yes,
expelled&mdash;from a club&mdash;the well-known Pickwick Club of
which I was the founder.&nbsp; Let him deny it if he
dare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the individual called out &ldquo;Bill
Stumps!&nbsp; Tell &rsquo;em about that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will not tell &rsquo;em, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pickwick, warmly;
&ldquo;they know it too well.&nbsp; It shall be known as long as
my name is known and when this person is consigned to the gutter
whence he came.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Humbug,&rdquo;
said Mr. Blotton, &ldquo;humbug you were and humbug you ever will
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Dr. Pettigrew, our excellent local
practitioner, interposed, &ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;is this to <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>go on; are
we to listen to this low abuse?&rdquo;&nbsp; A number of persons
closing round Blotton succeeded in ejecting him from the room,
and this truly painful incident closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>VISITORS AT THE DELL.</h4>
<blockquote><p>During the past week, Mr. Pickwick has been
entertaining a series of visitors&mdash;among others, Mr. Wardle,
of Manor Farm, Muggleton, Kent, with Miss Wardle, his
sister&mdash;the heroine of a most romantic story communicated to
us by Mr. Weller, though we are not privileged to lift the veil
from this interesting episode.&nbsp; But suffice it to say that
it comprised an elopement and exciting chase, in which Mr.
Pickwick, with his usual gallantry, took part.&nbsp; The
estrangement which necessarily followed between brother and
sister has long since been happily healed.&nbsp; Mr. Perker, the
eminent London solicitor&mdash;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s &ldquo;guide,
philosopher and friend&rdquo;&mdash;has also been staying at the
Dell.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>HUMOROUS ADVENTURE.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Our readers will be entertained by the following
droll contretemps which befel our deservedly popular
fellow-citizen, as we may call him, Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; As our
readers know, the Annual Charity Dinner took place at the
Greyhound, on Tuesday, Mr. Pickwick being in the chair, and
making many of his happiest speeches during the course of which
he related many curious details about himself and his life.&nbsp;
The party did not break up till a late hour&mdash;nearly eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; A fly&mdash;a special one, as
usual&mdash;had been retained to take Mr. Pickwick home, but as
the trusted Hobson, who invariably attends Mr. Pickwick on such
occasions, had another engagement, a stranger was procured from
Camberwell.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick was placed in the vehicle not, as
he says, without misgivings, and, as he admits, fell fast
asleep.&nbsp; He was driven home&mdash;as he fancied.&nbsp; On
arriving, the coachman had much difficulty in making himself
heard.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick entered the house, still scarcely
aroused, and turning into the study, sank into an armchair, and
once more fell into a slumber.&nbsp; He was presently aroused, he
says, by voices, and found himself surrounded by strange faces
and figures in various states of
<i>d&eacute;shabill&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; The head of the house, the
well-known Mr. Gibson, who had been roused from his slumbers, on
the maid, Mary Perkes, giving the alarm that robbers were in the
house, had rushed down in his trousers only; the man-servant
ditto; the young ladies in anything they could find.&nbsp; Mr.
Pickwick describes his alarm as he found these faces round him,
and, not unnaturally, conceived the idea that robbers had broken
into <i>his</i> house, and that his was in their power!&nbsp; A
humorous imbroglio followed.&nbsp; He instantly rushed to secure
the poker, and, flourishing it round his head, cried out
repeatedly, &ldquo;Keep off! every one of you! or I&rsquo;ll
brain the first man that comes near me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Fortunately,
the respected man-servant, who had been many years with Mr.
Gibson, and had met Mr. Weller, at once recognized Mr.
Weller&rsquo;s master, and said: &ldquo;Why, its Mr. Pickwick!
ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know <i>this</i>
ain&rsquo;t your own house, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; The truth then all
flashed upon him.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick relates that he became so
tickled <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>with the odd humour of his situation
that he fell into his chair in convulsions of laughter, and
laughed long and loudly, for many minutes.&nbsp; The more he
laughed, the more Mr. Gibson laughed.&nbsp; At last, all was
explained, and the amusing scene ended by a room being hastily
got ready for Mr. Pickwick (for the cabman had gone away).&nbsp;
No one was more amused, or indeed, more pleased, at these
&ldquo;mistakes of a night&rdquo; than Mr. Gibson, who always
tells the story with infinite drollery.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick takes
all the blame on himself, declaring, as he says his old friend
Winkle used to say: &ldquo;<i>It wasn&rsquo;t the wine</i>,
<i>but the salmon</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>ATTEMPTED ROBBERY AT MR. PICKWICK&rsquo;S HOUSE.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Last night, we are sorry to learn, a very daring
attempt was made to rob the mansion of our much esteemed
resident, Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; The Dell, as our readers know, is a
substantial dwelling-house, standing in its own grounds, and
comparatively unprotected.&nbsp; The family, consists of the
owner, his housekeeper, Mrs. Purdy, and his faithful servant, Mr.
Samuel Weller, whose pleasant humour is well-known, and who is
deservedly popular in Dulwich.&nbsp; Nothing was noticed until
about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when, as Mr. Weller has
informed us, he was awakened by a low, grinding sound, which, in
his quaint style, he says reminded him &ldquo;a fellow in
<i>quad</i> a-filing his irons.&rdquo;&nbsp; With much
promptitude he rose and, loosening the dog, proceeded in the
direction of the sounds; the villains, however, became alarmed,
and Mr. Weller was just in time to see them, as he says,
&ldquo;a-cuttin&rsquo; their lucky&rdquo; over the garden
wall.&nbsp; Much sympathy is expressed for the worthy and
deservedly esteemed Mr. Pickwick, and for the outrage done to his
feelings.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>FETE AT MR. PICKWICK&rsquo;S.</h4>
<blockquote><p>On Thursday last, this amiable and always
benevolent gentleman, who, it is known, takes the deepest
interest in the stage, invited all the brethren of the college to
a dinner, after which, he threw open his grounds to all his
acquaintances, indeed, to all Dulwich.&nbsp; The banquet was of a
sumptuous character, and was provided from the Greyhound.&nbsp;
After the usual loyal toasts, the warden proposed Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s health in appropriate terms, to which that
gentleman responded in an admirable speech, in which he reviewed
some portions of his life.&nbsp; After stating how dear and near
to his affection was the college and all that was concerned with
it, he entered into some various details of Ralph Alleyne, who,
as we all know, was an actor and connected with actors.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have already, by means of my researches, shown how
strangely related he was to myself, being of the same family with
an eminent physician in India, Mr. Benjamin Allen.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; I, myself, have known actors&mdash;one who was
known to his brethren as &lsquo;dismal Jemmy&rsquo;&mdash;(loud
laughter)&mdash;from, I suppose, the caste of characters he was
always assuming.&nbsp; Dismal Jemmy, however, had to leave the
country&mdash;(laughter)&mdash;I will not say why.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Roars of laughter.)&nbsp; Another actor whom he had known was
one of the most remarkable men he had ever met, for talent and
resources&mdash;would that he had confined his talent to its <!--
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>legitimate sphere, namely, on the
<i>boards</i>&mdash;but, unfortunately, he had chosen to exert it
at his, Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s, expense.&nbsp; (Loud
laughter.)&nbsp; This performer tried to live by his wits, as it
is called, and he, Mr. Pickwick, had encountered him, and his
wits, too and nearly always with success.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick then
humorously described some of his adventures with this person,
causing roars of laughter by a description of a night in the
garden of a Boarding School, into which he had been entrapped on
the pretext that the actor was about to run away with one of the
young ladies.&nbsp; In the most comic fashion, he related how he
had been captured by the whole school, headed by its principal,
and locked up in a cupboard, and was only released by his
faithful man, Sam, whom, personally, some of them
knew&mdash;(loud applause.)&nbsp; Well, after frustrating the
knavish tricks of this actor, he at last found him in a
debtors&rsquo; prison in the most abject misery and destitution,
and he was happy to tell them, that the man was completely
reformed, and getting an honest livelihood in one of our
colonies.&nbsp; Such was his experience of the actors&rsquo;
profession.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE AT IPSWICH.</h4>
<blockquote><p>An interesting event, in which our esteemed
fellow-citizen, Mr. Pickwick, has taken a deep interest, took
place at the historic town of Ipswich, when Mr. Sidney Porkenham,
eldest son of --- Porkenham, Esq., led to the altar at St.
Clement&rsquo;s Church, Henrietta, the beautiful and accomplished
daughter of --- Nupkins, Esq., late Mayor of that city.&nbsp;
Among the guests were J. Grigg, Esq., Mrs. and the Misses Grigg,
Mr. and Mrs. Slummin Towken and Mr. Slummin Towken, jun, ---
Jinks, Esq., and many more.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick had intended to be
present and had already promised to stay with Mr. Nupkins, but
was prevented by illness.&nbsp; His present to the bride, a
costly one and in exquisite taste, was purchased at
Micklethwaite&rsquo;s, High Street, Camberwell, where it was
exhibited and excited universal admiration.&nbsp; It consisted of
a watch and curb chain of the finest workmanship, for Mr.
Pickwick placed no limit on Micklethwaite.&nbsp; We understand
that at a recent dinner at Mr. Humberstone, our esteemed
rector&rsquo;s, Mr. Pickwick, after alluding to Miss Nupkins and
the coming marriage, literally convulsed the party by relating
his famous adventure at the Great White Horse, which he tells in
the raciest style, and how it led to his being led off prisoner,
and brought before his friend, Mr. Nupkins, then Mayor of
Ipswich.&nbsp; At the close he became a little pensive.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah! poor Peter Magnus! and Miss W---, sorry!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sorry, very.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our Rector has often
&ldquo;chaffed&rdquo; this worthy gentleman on his midnight
adventure, saying, waggishly, &ldquo;there was more in it than
met the eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have seen Mr. Pickwick smile, and he
would say, &ldquo;well, sir, she was a fine woman, a very fine
woman, and I&rsquo;m not going to kiss and tell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>MR. PICKWICK AT DULWICH POLICE COURT.</h4>
<blockquote><p>Thomas Bardell, aged 19, was charged before His
Worship, with extorting money under false pretences from Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; It appears from the gentleman&rsquo;s <!-- page
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>evidence, which he gave with great fulness, that, many
years ago, a woman of the name of Bardell, a lodging-house
keeper, brought an unfounded action against Mr. Pickwick, and
obtained damages which Mr. Pickwick refused to pay, preferring to
go to the Fleet Prison.&nbsp; This person had a son, then a mere
child, who was the prisoner.&nbsp; A week ago, Mr. Pickwick
received a piteous letter, signed Tommy Bardell, saying that his
mother was dying, and in the deepest distress, all their
furniture sold, or pawned.&nbsp; After making some inquiries, and
finding that there was a woman in distress at the place, Mr.
Pickwick sent the prisoner two sovereigns.&nbsp; Within a
fortnight he received a second application, saying that the
unhappy woman&rsquo;s bed was being taken away, &amp;c.; he sent
another sovereign.&nbsp; When he received a third application he
thought it high time to put it into the hands of his man, Sam
Weller, who made enquiries and found out there was no mother,
Mrs. Bardell being long, long since dead.&nbsp; His worship
committed him to jail for six months as a vagabond, but, at Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s request, reduced his sentence to two months.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II.&mdash;Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s Funeral.</h3>
<blockquote><p>The funeral <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> left the Dell at
ten o&rsquo;clock, and was one of the most striking displays of
public feeling that Dulwich has seen for many years.&nbsp; And
not only was Dulwich thus affected, but in Camberwell all the
numerous shops were closed, and the inhabitants turned out in
crowds.&nbsp; The procession comprised many mourning coaches
containing all Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s oldest friends.&nbsp; He had
survived all his relations.&nbsp; Among the mourners were Mr.
Wardle, of Dingley Dell, with his son-in-law, --- Trundle, Esq.;
Mr. Tupman, who travelled specially from Richmond; Messrs. Winkle
and Snodgrass, who had been his inseparable companions in his
famous tours; and --- Perker, Esq., who was the deceased&rsquo;s
legal adviser and confidential friend.&nbsp; An interesting
incident was the appearance among the mourners of an elderly
gentleman, Mr. Peter Magnus, between whom and Mr. Pickwick, as we
learn from his faithful servant, there had for many years been a
cloud or misunderstanding on account of some lady whose marriage
with Mr. Magnus Mr. Pickwick had unwittingly frustrated.&nbsp;
This injury, if injury there was, Mr. Magnus had buried in the
grave, and had rushed to Dulwich to lend his heartfelt
sympathy.&nbsp; Such things go far to reconcile one to human
nature, if such reconcilement be incumbent.&nbsp; A deputation
from the Dulwich Literary and Scientific Association, of which
Mr. Pickwick was Perpetual President, walked in the
procession.&nbsp; Passing the well-known Greyhound Inn, one of
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s favourite haunts, it was noticed the blinds
were drawn down.</p>
<p>We copy from the <i>Eatanswill Gazette</i> the following
admirable tribute to Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s merit, from the
vigorous pen, as we understand, of its Editor, Mr.
Pott:&mdash;&ldquo;Not only in Dulwich, but in Eatanswill, is
there mourning, to-day.&nbsp; We have lost
Pickwick&mdash;Pickwick the true and the Blue.&nbsp; For Blue he
was, to the very core and marrow of his bones, and it was we
ourselves, who first permeated him with real Blue
principles.&nbsp; Many a time and oft has he sat at our feet,
drinking in with rapture, <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>almost, the
stray scraps of immortal doctrine with which we favoured
him.&nbsp; Is it not an open secret that, but for
Pickwick&rsquo;s exertions&mdash;exertions which laid the
foundations of the disease which ultimately carried him
off&mdash;our late admirable member, the Honourable Samuel
Slumkey, would not have been returned?&nbsp; The <i>Gazette</i>,
it is true, first burst open the breach, in which Pickwick threw
himself, waving his flag on high, and led us on to victory.&nbsp;
Of course, our verminous contemporary, the <i>Independent</i>,
will scoff, and wipe its shoes on the illustrious dead.&nbsp; Of
course, the mangey creature&mdash;ceasing the while from its
perennial self-scratching&mdash;will hoot something
derogatory.&nbsp; Let it sneer, yelp aloud in its impotent
hog-like manner; let it root with its filthy snout among the
heaps of garbage where it loves to make its unclean haunt in
unspeakable Buffery.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill not serve&mdash;the
noisome fumes will stifle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We regret to say that these prognostications of Mr.
Pott&rsquo;s were but too soon, and too fatally realised, for in
almost the next issue of the <i>Independent</i>, we find a
scandalous and indecent attack on our late beloved Mr.
Pickwick.&nbsp; Shocking as it is, we cannot forbear, in duty to
the deceased gentleman, presenting it to our readers&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>&ldquo;POTT&rsquo;S PICKWICK.&rdquo;</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our emasculated contemporary, not content
with debauching Eatanswill politics, must go far afield and drag
from his grave an obscure and feeble being whom he claims to make
one of his besmirched heroes.&nbsp; But Potts&rsquo; praise, as
we have learned long since, is no more than daubing its object
with dirt.&nbsp; Why, this very Pickwick whom he
belauds&mdash;can it be forgotten how Eatanswill shook its sides
with laughter at the figure he made our besotted contemporary
cut?&nbsp; Who will forget Mr. W---le, his creature, whom
Pickwick introduced into the Potts&rsquo; household and the
resulting scandal, how Mr. W---le, aforesaid, fled from the
house, leaving the belated Ariadne in tears?&nbsp; Does Pott
forget who it was put his finger on this spot and, for the fair
fame of Eatanswill, clamoured for its extinction?&nbsp; Who
forgets our warnings and their fulfilment?&nbsp; The arrival of
the Lieutenant; the menaced proceedings in a certain court; the
departure of the fair but frail culprit.&nbsp; And yet Pott with
an ineffable effrontery that would do credit to a fishwife in and
from Billingsgate, clamours about this Pickwick and his virtues,
and drops his maudlin tears upon his coffin!&nbsp; Why was he not
there to give his hand to Mr. Lothario W---le, who, we
understand, was also present?&nbsp; By the way, we have received
the following lines from a valued correspondent:&mdash;</p>
<p>Your tears you may sprinkle<br />
O W---le, O W---le,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With more of this same kind of rot.<br />
The lady so gay<br />
Could not say you nay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merely bidding you &lsquo;<i>Go to
Pot</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our hide-bound contemporary, will not, of course, see the
point&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>We are grieved to say, that the indecent Eatanswill
controversy over the lamented Mr. Pickwick still goes on.&nbsp;
More strictly speaking, however, he has dropped out of sight
owing to the inflamed passions which have been roused between the
editors.&nbsp; Our sympathies are, we need not say, with Mr.
Pott, still we wish he would somewhat temper his language, out of
respect for the dead.&nbsp; Here is his crushing
retort&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>&ldquo;FILTH ON THE COFFIN.&rdquo;</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have seen at some historic funeral, say
of some personage obnoxious to the mob, dead dogs, cats, rats,
and rotten eggs, hurled from a safe distance at the passing
coffin.&nbsp; This is what our fast decomposing and wholly
noisome contemporary is now doing.&nbsp; Shall we say it?&nbsp;
How beastly, how congenial to the man&rsquo;s feelings!&nbsp;
Paugh!&nbsp; Decency; propriety; sense of restraint; all unknown
terms in his Malay tongue&mdash;for this Swift&rsquo;s
yahoo.&nbsp; But we know what rankles.&nbsp; Has our contemporary
in mind a chastisement that was inflicted on him in the kitchen
of a certain inn, and in the presence of Pickwick
himself&mdash;has he forgotten the fire irons&mdash;or, to speak
accurately, <i>the</i> fire irons.&nbsp; That bruise, we dare
swear, is still raw.&nbsp; But there are pole-cats who cannot
divest themselves of their odour, do what they will, and this
festering mass of decaying garbage, which goes by the name of
<i>The Independent</i>, and which is unaccountably overlooked by
the night men in their rounds, is fast breeding a pestilence in
the pure air of Eatanswill.&rdquo;&nbsp; This lamentable
controversy still continues.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>STRANGE INCIDENT.</h4>
<blockquote><p>We noticed among the company at Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s funeral a gentleman of unobstrusive exterior,
who seemed to be vainly seeking his place, and to whom our
representative offered his services.&nbsp; It turned out that his
name was Trundle, and that he was one of the appointed
pall-bearers, but that he had been unaccountably overlooked, and
his place taken by someone else.&nbsp; Mr. Trundle made no
complaint, but our representative thought it his duty to mention
the circumstance to Mr. Wardle, who, it appears, is his
father-in-law, but who only smiled, good-humouredly saying
&ldquo;O, Trundle, to be sure.&nbsp; No one minds him and
<i>he</i> won&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; But no further attention
was paid to the matter.&nbsp; Mr. Trundle, our representative
adds, was a man of modest and retiring ways, and did not seem in

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
